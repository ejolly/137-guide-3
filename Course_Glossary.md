*(See Lecture 09‑29: History; Lecture 10‑01 recap slides)*

### Dualism

**Time period:** Late 1500s–1600s\
The view that the **mind and body are separate substances**: the body obeys physical laws and reflexes, while the mind enables free will and conscious thought.\
**Notable Figure:** René Descartes\
**Example:** Reflexive pinprick vs. intentional act of writing a poem.\
**Related Concepts:** Contrasts with **Empiricism**; reframed by **Cognitivism** and **Predictive Mind** perspectives.

### Empiricism

**Time period:** Late 1600s–1700s\
The idea that the **mind starts as a blank slate (tabula rasa)** and that knowledge is built from **experience and association**.\
**Notable Figure:** John Locke\
**Related Concepts:** Precursor to **Behaviorism** (learning through conditioning); challenged by **Cognitive Science** and **Chomsky** on innate structure.

### Behaviorism

**Time period:** Early 1900s\
A movement emphasizing **observable behavior and conditioning**, rejecting introspection.\
**Notable Figures:** Pavlov (classical conditioning), Skinner (operant conditioning), Watson (conditioning of emotions).\
**Example:** The "Little Albert" experiment showed conditioned fear responses.\
**Related Concepts:** Preceded the **Cognitive Revolution** and **Constructivism**.

### Cognitivism

**Time period:** 1930s–1950s→1960s\
Reintroduced **mental structure** (schemas, attributions, holistic impressions) as essential to understanding behavior.\
**Notable Figures:** Bartlett (schemas), Asch (Gestalt impression formation), Heider (attributions).\
**Related Concepts:** Leads into **Cognitive Psychology**, **Attribution Theory**, and **Mentalizing**.

### Cognitive Psychology

**Time period:** 1960s\
Defines psychology as the study of how input is **transformed, stored, and used**, even in absence of stimuli.\
**Notable Figure:** Ulric Neisser\
**Key Idea:** Cognition as information processing.\
**Related Concepts:** Bridges to **Cognitive Science** and **Marr’s Levels**.

### Cognitive Science

**Time period:** 1960s–1970s\
An interdisciplinary field treating the **mind as an information-processing system**, integrating psychology, AI, linguistics, and philosophy.\
**Notable Figures:** Turing, Simon, Chomsky\
**Related Concepts:** Precursor to **Computational Cognitive Science** and **Intentional Stance**.

### Computational Cognitive Science

**Time period:** 1970s–1980s\
Explains cognition in terms of **representations and algorithms**. Introduced **Marr’s Levels of Analysis**.\
**Notable Figures:** David Marr, Allen Newell, Herbert Simon\
**Related Concepts:** Foundation for **Predictive Models** and **Generative Models**.

### Constructivism

**Time period:** 1960s–1970s\
Perception and memory are **active constructions** from prior knowledge and input.\
**Notable Figure:** Jerome Bruner\
**Example:** “The dress” illusion illustrates perceptual priors.\
**Related Concepts:** Supports **Predictive Mind**; informs **Mentalizing**.

### Field Theory

**Time period:** 1940s\
Behavior is a **function of the person and environment** (*B = f(P, E)*); Lewin's equation; grand-truism\
**Notable Figure:** Kurt Lewin\
**Key Idea:** Behavior arises from dynamic forces within a person’s "life space."\
**Related Concepts:** Foundation for **Attribution Theory** and **Representations (R)**.

### Predictive Mind

**Time period:** 1990s–present\
The brain generates **predictions** about the world (including other minds) and updates via **prediction error**.\
**Notable Figures:** Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy\
**Related Concepts:** Unifies **Mentalizing**, **Generative Models**, and **Cognitive Neuroscience**.

## II. Core Concepts (A–Z)

### Agency

The perceived **capacity to plan, control, and act intentionally**. Contrasts with **Experience**.\
**Example:** A robot vacuum seems agentic when it navigates obstacles.\
**Related Concepts:** Dimension of **Mentalizing**; linked to **Action Transitions**.

### Animacy

Perceived **aliveness** or possession of mind, inferred from motion cues like **self-propulsion** or **goal-directed movement**. Perceptual cues include but are not limited to **biological motion**, **interaction contingency**, and **efficient goal pursuit**.\
**Example:** A triangle chasing a circle appears alive.\
**Related Concepts:** Triggers **Intentional Stance** and **Mentalizing**.

### Attribution Theory

The idea that people are **naïve scientists** explaining behavior through **automatically** inferred **internal states** (beliefs, desires) or **situational causes**.\
**Notable Figure:** Fritz Heider\
**Citation:** Heider & Simmel (1944)\
**Related Concepts:** Basis for **Theory of Mind** and **Intentional Stance**.

### Biological Motion

The perception of movement that implies **life or intention**, as in **point-light displays** (Johansson, 1973).\
**Example:** People recognize human gait from dots representing joints.\
**Related Concepts:** Supports **Animacy** and **Mentalizing**.

### Cross-Modal Dynamics

Parallel expressive patterns across **vision and audition** (animations & music) that reveal a shared code for social meaning.\
**Example:** Fast, irregular motion or sound conveys agitation.\
**Related Concepts:** Extends **Biological Motion**; cue to **Animacy**.

### Design Stance

Predict behavior from an object’s **function/design** (e.g., a thermostat turns on heat).\
**Notable Figure:** Daniel Dennett\
**Related Concepts:** One of three stances (Physical, Design, Intentional).

### Experience

The perceived **capacity to feel sensations and emotions**.\
**Example:** We attribute high Experience but low Agency to a baby or pet.\
**Related Concepts:** Dimension of **Mentalizing**.

### False-Belief Task

A classic **Theory of Mind** test: predicting others’ behavior based on what they believe, not reality (e.g., Sally-Anne task).\
**Related Concepts:** Demonstrates **Belief–Desire Reasoning** and **Metarepresentation**.

### Flatland Fallacy

The tendency to favor **oversimplified explanations** (e.g., two dimensions for complex phenomena).\
**Example:** Ignoring richness of cognition by reducing it to a single factor.\
**Related Concepts:** Motivates **Computational Modeling** and **Marr’s Levels**.

<!-- ### Generative Model

An internal model linking **hidden mental states** (beliefs, goals) to **observable actions**.\
**Related Concepts:** Core of the **Predictive Mind** framework. -->

### Intentional Stance

A strategy for predicting behavior by assuming **beliefs, desires, and rationality**.\
**Notable Figure:** Daniel Dennett\
**Related Concepts:** Complements **Design** and **Physical** stances; triggered by **Animacy**.

### Marr’s Computational Level

Focuses on **what** the system does and **why** — the goals and purpose of the process.\
**Notable Figure:** David Marr\
**Related Concepts:** Part of **Marr’s Levels**; complements **Algorithmic** and **Implementational** analyses.

### Marr’s Algorithmic Level

Focuses on **how** the process is achieved — the **representations** and operations involved.\
**Notable Figure:** David Marr\
**Related Concepts:** Bridges **Computational** and **Implementational** levels.

### Marr’s Implementational Level

Focuses on the **physical mechanisms** that realize computation (e.g., neural circuits, hardware).\
**Notable Figure:** David Marr\
**Related Concepts:** Connects theory to biology; links to **Cognitive Neuroscience**.

### Mentalizing

The act of **attributing mental states** to others — also called **Mind Perception**. Occurs automatically and supports social prediction.\
**Related Concepts:** Precedes **Theory of Mind** as the perceptual step; driven by **Animacy**, **Agency**, and **Experience**.

### Physical Stance

Predict behavior from **physical laws** (e.g., gravity).\
**Notable Figure:** Daniel Dennett\
**Related Concepts:** Simpler than **Design** or **Intentional** stances.

### Predictive Mind / Predictive Processing

Brains continuously **generate predictions** and update via **prediction errors**.\
**Example:** Anticipating another’s next action.\
**Related Concepts:** Framework uniting **Generative Models** and **Social Prediction**.

### Representation

An **internal encoding** that mediates between perception and action; the modern addition to Lewin’s equation (*B = f(P, E, R)*).\
**Related Concepts:** Central to **Cognitivism**, **Computational Models**, and **Predictive Mind**.

### Symbolic System (SS)

Architecture with Memory, Control, I/O, and Operators (Assign, Copy, Read/Write, Continue-IF). Implements symbolic theories of cognition.  
**Notable Figures:** Newell & Simon.  
**Related Concepts:** Representation, Cognitive Science

### Transition Structure

Knowledge of how **mental states and actions change over time**, enabling **predictions** about others.\
**Example:** Anger → Regret or Knock → Enter sequences.\
**Related Concepts:** Evidence for **Predictive Mind**.

### Theory of Mind (ToM)

The capacity to **represent others’ beliefs, desires, and intentions** to explain and predict behavior.\
