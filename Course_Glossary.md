## II. Core Concepts (A–Z)

### Agency

The perceived **capacity to plan, control, and act intentionally**. Contrasts with **Experience**.\
**Example:** A robot vacuum seems agentic when it navigates obstacles.\
**Related Concepts:** Dimension of **Mentalizing**; linked to **Action Transitions**.

### Animacy

Perceived **aliveness** or possession of mind, inferred from motion cues like **self-propulsion** or **goal-directed movement**. Perceptual cues include but are not limited to **biological motion**, **interaction contingency**, and **efficient goal pursuit**.\
**Example:** A triangle chasing a circle appears alive.\
**Related Concepts:** Triggers **Intentional Stance** and **Mentalizing**.

### Animalistic Dehumanization

Denying **Uniquely Human (UH)** traits; implicitly or explicitly likening others to animals; associated with emotions of disgust/contempt; typically occurs in intergroup contexts.\
**Notable Figures:** Haslam; Leyens\
**Related Concepts:** **Moral exclusion**; **Mechanistic Dehumanization**; **Uniquely Human**.

### Attribution Theory

The idea that people are **naïve scientists** explaining behavior through **automatically** inferred **internal states** (beliefs, desires) or **situational causes**.\
**Notable Figure:** Fritz Heider\
**Citation:** Heider & Simmel (1944)\
**Related Concepts:** Basis for **Theory of Mind** and **Intentional Stance**.

### Biological Motion

The perception of movement that implies **life or intention**, as in **point-light displays** (Johansson, 1973).\
**Example:** People recognize human gait from dots representing joints.\
**Related Concepts:** Supports **Animacy** and **Mentalizing**.

### Cross-Modal Dynamics

Parallel expressive patterns across **vision and audition** (animations & music) that reveal a shared code for social meaning.\
**Example:** Fast, irregular motion or sound conveys agitation.\
**Related Concepts:** Extends **Biological Motion**; cue to **Animacy**.

### Design Stance

Predict behavior from an object’s **function/design** (e.g., a thermostat turns on heat).\
**Notable Figure:** Daniel Dennett\
**Related Concepts:** One of three stances (Physical, Design, Intentional).

### Experience

The perceived **capacity to feel sensations and emotions**.\
**Example:** We attribute high Experience but low Agency to a baby or pet.\
**Related Concepts:** Dimension of **Mentalizing**.

### False-Belief Task

A classic **Theory of Mind** test: predicting others' behavior based on what they believe, not reality (e.g., Sally-Anne task).\
**Related Concepts:** Demonstrates **Belief–Desire Reasoning** and **Metarepresentation**.

### Forward Model

A predictive mapping from **motor command to expected sensory consequences**; used to distinguish self-caused from external events and can be co-opted to estimate others' intentions by simulating their motor commands.\
**Notable Figures:** Wolpert, Miall\
**Related Concepts:** **Efference copy**; **Simulation Theory**; **Predictive Mind**.

### Flatland Fallacy

The tendency to favor **oversimplified explanations** (e.g., two dimensions for complex phenomena).\
**Example:** Ignoring richness of cognition by reducing it to a single factor.\
**Related Concepts:** Motivates **Computational Modeling** and **Marr’s Levels**.

<!-- ### Generative Model

An internal model linking **hidden mental states** (beliefs, goals) to **observable actions**.\
**Related Concepts:** Core of the **Predictive Mind** framework. -->

### H1 (Desire Heuristic)

A computational heuristic that predicts action from **desires alone** when they yield a unique prediction; simpler and less costly than belief-desire reasoning.\
**Notable Figures:** Fodor\
**Related Concepts:** **Simple desire psychology**; **H2**; **Theory of Mind**.

### H2 (Belief+Desire Heuristic)

A computational heuristic that incorporates both **beliefs and desires** when H1 is underdetermined; computationally costlier but more reliable.\
**Notable Figures:** Fodor\
**Related Concepts:** **False-Belief Task**; **H1**; **Theory of Mind**.

### Human Nature (HN)

Traits seen as **core/innate to humans** (e.g., warmth, emotionality, agency, depth). Denial of HN traits leads to **mechanistic dehumanization**.\
**Notable Figures:** Haslam\
**Related Concepts:** **Empathy**; **Mechanistic Dehumanization**; **Agency**.

### Intentional Stance

A strategy for predicting behavior by assuming **beliefs, desires, and rationality**.\
**Notable Figure:** Daniel Dennett\
**Related Concepts:** Complements **Design** and **Physical** stances; triggered by **Animacy**.

### Life Detector

Local visual filters sensitive to **foot acceleration patterns** consistent with gravity and ballistic motion; provides fast, shape-independent cues for detecting living beings.\
**Notable Figures:** Troje, Chang\
**Related Concepts:** **Animacy**; **Biological Motion**.

### Marr's Computational Level

Focuses on **what** the system does and **why** — the goals and purpose of the process.\
**Notable Figure:** David Marr\
**Related Concepts:** Part of **Marr’s Levels**; complements **Algorithmic** and **Implementational** analyses.

### Marr’s Algorithmic Level

Focuses on **how** the process is achieved — the **representations** and operations involved.\
**Notable Figure:** David Marr\
**Related Concepts:** Bridges **Computational** and **Implementational** levels.

### Marr's Implementational Level

Focuses on the **physical mechanisms** that realize computation (e.g., neural circuits, hardware).\
**Notable Figure:** David Marr\
**Related Concepts:** Connects theory to biology; links to **Cognitive Neuroscience**.

### Mechanistic Dehumanization

Denying **Human Nature (HN)** traits; representing others as objects/machines; associated with emotions of indifference; occurs interpersonally and in institutional contexts (e.g., medicine).\
**Notable Figures:** Haslam\
**Related Concepts:** **Objectification**; **Animalistic Dehumanization**; **Human Nature (HN)**.

### Mentalizing

The act of **attributing mental states** to others — also called **Mind Perception**. Occurs automatically and supports social prediction.\
**Related Concepts:** Precedes **Theory of Mind** as the perceptual step; driven by **Animacy**, **Agency**, and **Experience**.

### Naïve Utility Calculus

An intuitive generative model that represents agents as planning to **maximize expected utility** (rewards minus costs); observers infer agents' preferences, beliefs, and competence by **Bayesian inversion** of this planning model.\
**Notable Figures:** Jara-Ettinger, Tenenbaum\
**Related Concepts:** **Theory of Mind**; **Predictive Mind**; **Inverse planning**.

### Physical Stance

Predict behavior from **physical laws** (e.g., gravity).\
**Notable Figure:** Daniel Dennett\
**Related Concepts:** Simpler than **Design** or **Intentional** stances.

### Predictive Mind / Predictive Processing

Brains continuously **generate predictions** and update via **prediction errors**.\
**Example:** Anticipating another’s next action.\
**Related Concepts:** Framework uniting **Generative Models** and **Social Prediction**.

### Representation

An **internal encoding** that mediates between perception and action; the modern addition to Lewin’s equation (*B = f(P, E, R)*); predictive in nature\
**Related Concepts:** Central to **Cognitivism**, **Computational Models**, and **Predictive Mind**.

### Simulation Theory

A theory proposing that we represent other minds by **generating similar processes in oneself**; involves motor resonance and embodied simulation.\
**Notable Figures:** Goldman\
**Related Concepts:** **Mirror system**; **Forward Model**; **Theory of Mind**.

### Structure-from-Motion

Global integration of correlated part motions to yield articulated **3D shape**; allows recovery of body configuration from **point-light displays**.\
**Notable Figures:** Johansson, Ullman\
**Related Concepts:** **Point-light displays**; **Biological Motion**.

### Synchrony

**Time-locked coupling** across neural, physiological, and behavioral signals between interacting agents that supports **mutual prediction** and connection. Synchrony serves as both an index (marker) and mechanism (causal factor) for social bonding — aligning communication windows to reduce prediction error and creating subjective experiences of closeness.\
**Example:** People tapping in rhythm together report increased trust and liking; musical ensembles and religious rituals exploit synchrony for group cohesion.\
**Citations:** Wheatley et al. (2012), Wheatley et al. (2023)\
**Related Concepts:** supports **Predictive Mind** (phase alignment reduces joint prediction error); linked to **Cross-Modal Dynamics** and **Biological Motion** as interaction cues.

### Symbolic System (SS)

Architecture with Memory, Control, I/O, and Operators (Assign, Copy, Read/Write, Continue-IF). Implements symbolic theories of cognition.\
**Notable Figures:** Newell & Simon.\
**Related Concepts:** Representation, Cognitive Science

### Theory of Mind (ToM)

**Notable Figures:** Premack & Woodruff (1978)\
**Related Concepts:** Built upon **Mentalizing** and **Generative Models**.

### Third Visual Pathway

A lateral visual stream projecting from early visual areas via motion-selective regions (MT/V5) into the **superior temporal sulcus (STS)**, specialized for extracting dynamic social signals (gaze, expression, body movement).\
**Notable Figures:** Pitcher, Ungerleider\
**Related Concepts:** **STS**; **Biological Motion**; **Animacy**.

### Transition Structure

Knowledge of how **mental states and actions change over time**, enabling **predictions** about others.\
**Example:** Anger → Regret or Knock → Enter sequences.\
**Related Concepts:** Evidence for **Predictive Mind**.

### Uniquely Human (UH)

Traits perceived as **distinctive to humans** (e.g., higher cognition, moral refinement, language, civility). Denial of UH traits leads to **animalistic dehumanization**.\
**Notable Figures:** Haslam; Leyens\
**Related Concepts:** **Infra-humanization**; **Animalistic Dehumanization**.
