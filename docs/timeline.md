*(See Lecture 09‑29: History; Lecture 10‑01 recap slides)*

## Dualism

**Time period:** Late 1500s–1600s\
The view that the **mind and body are separate substances**: the body obeys physical laws and reflexes, while the mind enables free will and conscious thought.\
**Notable Figure:** René Descartes\
**Example:** Reflexive pinprick vs. intentional act of writing a poem.\
**Related Concepts:** Contrasts with **Empiricism**; reframed by **Cognitivism** and **Predictive Mind** perspectives.

## Empiricism

**Time period:** Late 1600s–1700s\
The idea that the **mind starts as a blank slate (tabula rasa)** and that knowledge is built from **experience and association**.\
**Notable Figure:** John Locke\
**Related Concepts:** Precursor to **Behaviorism** (learning through conditioning); challenged by **Cognitive Science** and **Chomsky** on innate structure.

## Behaviorism

**Time period:** Early 1900s\
A movement emphasizing **observable behavior and conditioning**, rejecting introspection.\
**Notable Figures:** Pavlov (classical conditioning), Skinner (operant conditioning), Watson (conditioning of emotions).\
**Example:** The "Little Albert" experiment showed conditioned fear responses.\
**Related Concepts:** Preceded the **Cognitive Revolution** and **Constructivism**.

## Cognitivism

**Time period:** 1930s–1950s→1960s\
Reintroduced **mental structure** (schemas, attributions, holistic impressions) as essential to understanding behavior.\
**Notable Figures:** Bartlett (schemas), Asch (Gestalt impression formation), Heider (attributions).\
**Related Concepts:** Leads into **Cognitive Psychology**, **Attribution Theory**, and **Mentalizing**.

## Cognitive Psychology

**Time period:** 1960s\
Defines psychology as the study of how input is **transformed, stored, and used**, even in absence of stimuli.\
**Notable Figure:** Ulric Neisser\
**Key Idea:** Cognition as information processing.\
**Related Concepts:** Bridges to **Cognitive Science** and **Marr’s Levels**.

## Cognitive Science

**Time period:** 1960s–1970s\
An interdisciplinary field treating the **mind as an information-processing system**, integrating psychology, AI, linguistics, and philosophy.\
**Notable Figures:** Turing, Simon, Chomsky\
**Related Concepts:** Precursor to **Computational Cognitive Science** and **Intentional Stance**.

## Computational Cognitive Science

**Time period:** 1970s–1980s\
Explains cognition in terms of **representations and algorithms**. Introduced **Marr’s Levels of Analysis**.\
**Notable Figures:** David Marr, Allen Newell, Herbert Simon\
**Related Concepts:** Foundation for **Predictive Models** and **Generative Models**.

## Constructivism

**Time period:** 1960s–1970s\
Perception and memory are **active constructions** from prior knowledge and input.\
**Notable Figure:** Jerome Bruner\
**Example:** “The dress” illusion illustrates perceptual priors.\
**Related Concepts:** Supports **Predictive Mind**; informs **Mentalizing**.

## Field Theory

**Time period:** 1940s\
Behavior is a **function of the person and environment** (*B = f(P, E)*); Lewin's equation; grand-truism\
**Notable Figure:** Kurt Lewin\
**Key Idea:** Behavior arises from dynamic forces within a person’s "life space."\
**Related Concepts:** Foundation for **Attribution Theory** and **Representations (R)**.

## Predictive Mind

**Time period:** 1990s–present\
The brain generates **predictions** about the world (including other minds) and updates via **prediction error**.\
**Notable Figures:** Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy\
**Related Concepts:** Unifies **Mentalizing**, **Generative Models**, and **Cognitive Neuroscience**.
