# Challenge 1 Study Guide

This site contains several additional resources to help you prepare for Challenge 1. You should treat this as a *supplemental resource* to lecture slides, attendance & podcasts.

!> These resources are **not comprehensive** and should serve as a general starting point and/or refresher. Make sure to refer to the actual lectures for details that might be missing here. "It wasn't in the study guide" won't be an acceptable excuse!

?> Full lecture slides, podcasts, paper PDFs, & videos are available on [Canvas](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/70082).

## Suggested uses

There are few ways you might find it helpful to review this material:

- Start with [historical perspectives](timeline.md) then go through [lecture notes](lecture-notes/index.md) reviewing any [glossary terms](glossary.md) and/or [papers](paper-summaries/index.md) for more context
- Start with the [glossary](glossary.md) and treat it like wikipedia. Jump around to different [papers](paper-summaries/index.md) and [lecture notes](lecture-notes/index.md) for more context
- Or just use whatever study methods work for you and use the *search box* to find anything in the guide you're looking for

## AI study help (optional)

You might also find it helpful to *chat* with each week's lecture materials or the full list of all lecture transcripts using the optional course NotebookLM:

- Week 0 slides & papers: https://tinyurl.com/137-intro
- Week 1 slides & papers: https://tinyurl.com/137-week-01
- Week 2 slides & papers: https://tinyurl.com/137-week-02
- Week 3 slides & papers: https://tinyurl.com/137-week-03
- All lecture recordings: https://tinyurl.com/137-part-1

Canvas also includes an "AI-lecture-recaps" Module that has brief (5-7min) refresher videos based on full lecture transcripts using NotebookLM!

!> AI generate summaries and chats can sometimes be *more* confusing if you're asking about *nuanced details*. When this happens, try asking it to refer to specific lecture slides to force it to explain things in a more *class-consistent* way. However, for the final say always refer directly to lecture slides & podcasts!
