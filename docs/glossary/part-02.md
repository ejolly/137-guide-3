## Statistical Decision Theory

- **Definition**: Early formalism asking what outcome a rational player should expect when a chance game is played repeatedly: maximize expected value.
- **Other ways to think about it**: Probability‑based logic for repeated gambles.
- **Lecture & slide**: 10-24, slides 8–11
- **Example(s)**: Deriving EV by weighting outcomes by probabilities for a fair game.
- **Related**: [Expected Value (EV)](#expected-value-ev), [Expected Value Theory](#expected-value-theory)


## Strategy

- **Definition**: A plan or rule determining a player’s action(s) in a game (e.g., cooperate/defect; respond to the opponent’s last move).
- **Other ways to think about it**: Your decision rule in a strategic setting.
- **Lecture & slide**: 10-29, slide 22; 10-31, slides 13–16
- **Example(s)**: Tit‑for‑Tat in IPD (start cooperatively, then copy the partner’s previous move).
- **Related**: [Game](#game), [Payoff](#payoff), [Nash Equilibrium](#nash-equilibrium)


## Tit‑for‑Tat (TFT)

- **Definition**: A simple strategy for IPD: Cooperate on the first move; thereafter, do exactly what your partner did last round.
- **Other ways to think about it**: Be nice, retaliate quickly, and forgive quickly.
- **Lecture & slide**: 10-31, slides 13–16; 11-05, slides 8, 14–16
- **Example(s)**: Starting with C, then mirroring D or C in subsequent rounds.

### Tragedy of the Commons

- **Definition**: When individually rational choices to not contribute (defect) deplete a shared resource, reducing group welfare.
- **Other ways to think about it**: Collective ruin from self‑interest in shared systems.
- **Lecture & slide**: 11-05, slide 22
- **Example(s)**: Declining contributions in the PGG over rounds when others free‑ride.

- **Notable figure(s)**: Garrett Hardin


### Transitivity (EUT Axiom)

- **Definition**: If A ≥ B and B ≥ C, then A ≥ C. Preferences are internally consistent and non‑circular.
- **Other ways to think about it**: No cycles like A ≻ B ≻ C ≻ A.
- **Lecture & slide**: 10-24, slides 24–25
- **Example(s)**: 
- **Related**: [Expected Utility Theory (EUT)](#expected-utility-theory-eut), [Completeness (EUT Axiom)](#completeness-eut-axiom), [Independence (EUT Axiom)](#independence-eut-axiom), [Continuity (EUT Axiom)](#continuity-eut-axiom)


## Utility

- **Definition**: Subjective value or desirability of an outcome (how good it *feels*), which need not scale linearly with money.
- **Other ways to think about it**: Psychological value, not just dollars.
- **Lecture & slide**: 10-24, slides 16–19
- **Example(s)**: Utility of an extra $100 decreases as wealth increases (diminishing marginal utility).
- **Related**: [Expected Utility](#expected-utility), [Utility Function](#utility-function), [Expected Utility Theory (EUT)](#expected-utility-theory-eut)


## Utility Function

- **Definition**: A function mapping objective outcomes (e.g., money) to subjective utility, often concave for gains (diminishing marginal utility).
- **Other ways to think about it**: Curve translating money to feeling.
- **Lecture & slide**: 10-24, slides 20–22; 10-27, slides 4–5
- **Example(s)**: U($) that rises with money but with decreasing slope.
- **Related**: [Expected Utility](#expected-utility), [Expected Utility Theory (EUT)](#expected-utility-theory-eut), [Value Function (Prospect Theory)](#value-function-prospect-theory)


## Value Function (Prospect Theory)

- **Definition**: Reference‑dependent mapping from outcomes to subjective value: concave for gains, convex for losses, and steeper for losses (loss aversion).
- **Other ways to think about it**: How outcomes feel relative to a baseline.
- **Lecture & slide**: 10-27, slide 17
- **Example(s)**: Gaining $100 feels good but less than the pain of losing $100; smaller sensitivity to changes far from the reference point.
- **Related**: [Prospect Theory](#prospect-theory), [Reference Point](#reference-point), [Loss Aversion](#loss-aversion)


## Violations of EUT

- **Definition**: Systematic patterns that contradict EUT predictions, such as the **Certainty Effect** and **Ambiguity Aversion**.
- **Other ways to think about it**: Where people depart from the axioms.
- **Lecture & slide**: 10-27, slides 11–12; 10-24, slide 26 (early evidence)
- **Example(s)**: Preferring a sure $400 to a 50% chance at $1000 (gain domain), or preferring a risky loss to avoid a sure loss (loss domain).
- **Related**: [Certainty Effect](#certainty-effect), [Ambiguity Aversion](#ambiguity-aversion), [Prospect Theory](#prospect-theory)
