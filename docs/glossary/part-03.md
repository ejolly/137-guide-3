## Affect

- **Definition**: A broad, continuous internal feeling state that can be described in terms of **valence** (positive–negative) and **arousal** (activated–deactivated), often serving as an internal social signal that the brain has to interpret.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: The background “mood signal” of your body; a low-resolution summary of how good or bad and how revved-up or sluggish your internal state is.
- **Lecture & slide**: 12-01 (Part 3: Lecture 8 – Affect, Self, & Summary), slides 60–66, 126–133  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - Feeling “amped and excited” (high arousal, positive valence) versus “drained and gloomy” (low arousal, negative valence) even when nothing specific has just happened.  
- **Related**: [Circumplex Model of Affect](#circumplex-model-of-affect), [Mood as Information](#mood-as-information), [Visceral Signals](#visceral-signals)

---

## Affective Computing

- **Definition**: The area of computer science and cognitive science focused on using computational tools (e.g., computer vision models) to detect, track, and model human affective states—especially from signals like facial expressions.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: Teaching machines to be “good at feelings” in the sense of imitating how humans judge emotions from faces and other signals.
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-21 (Part 3: Lecture 5 – External Signals & Affective Computing), slides 21–23, 87–104  
  - 11-24 (Part 3: Lecture 6 – Affective Computing & Emotion Recognition), slides 46–48, 242–262

---

## Appraisal Theories (Emotion)

- **Definition**: Theories of emotion that propose emotions arise from **evaluations (appraisals)** of situations relative to goals, beliefs, and concerns—not from fixed, hard-wired emotion modules. Different appraisals produce different emotional experiences and expressions.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: Emotions as “what you get when your brain runs a causal analysis of what just happened to you and what it means.”
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-26 (Part 3: Lecture 7 – How the Brain Sees Faces), slides ~638–649 (summary of emotion theories)  
  - 12-01 (Part 3: Lecture 8 – Affect, Self, & Summary), slides 69–112  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - Feeling angry rather than afraid when someone bumps into you because you appraise it as intentional disrespect rather than an accident.  
- **Related**: [Circumplex Model of Affect](#circumplex-model-of-affect), [Constructivist/Core Affect Theories](#constructivistcore-affect-theories), [Visceral Signals](#visceral-signals)

---


## Categorization

- **Definition**: The idea that perception is not a passive recording of sensory input but an **active process of assigning stimuli to categories**, using cues to infer “what kind of thing” something is.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: Seeing is partly **labeling**—your brain is always asking “what is this like?” and sorting inputs into buckets.
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-12 (Part 3: Lecture 1 – Social Signals & Groups), slides 7–8 (Bruner quote, “Perception is an act of categorization”)  
  - 11-14 (Part 3: Lecture 2 – Categorization & Stereotyping), slide 22  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - Seeing a square but immediately perceiving it as a “water bottle” despite its unusual shape.  
  - Quickly classifying a stranger as “in-group” or “out-group” based on shirt color in a minimal group study.  
- **Related**: [Social Categories](#social-categories), [Stereotypes](#stereotypes), [Signal Construction](#signal-construction), [Social Perception (Impressions from Faces)](#social-perception-impressions-from-faces)

## Circumplex Model of Affect

- **Definition**: A model (Russell, 1980) that represents affective states in a two-dimensional space defined by **valence** (positive–negative) and **arousal** (high–low).  
- **Other ways to think about it**: A coordinate system for feelings—every emotion word is somewhere in the “how good/bad” × “how activated” space.
- **Lecture & slide**: 12-01, slides 126–133 (“Circumplex model (Russell, 1980)” under “Affect as an internal social signal”)  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - “Excited” = high arousal, positive valence; “calm” = low arousal, positive valence; “anxious” = high arousal, negative valence.  
- **Related**: [Affect](#affect), [Mood as Information](#mood-as-information), [Constructivist/Core Affect Theories](#constructivistcore-affect-theories)

---

## Constructivist/Core Affect Theories

- **Definition**: Theories (e.g., Lisa Feldman Barrett, Russell) claiming that emotions are **conceptual interpretations** built on top of more primitive [affect](#affect) signals (valence, arousal), shaped by language, culture, and conceptual knowledge.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: Emotions as **category labels** your brain learns to apply to blurry feelings, rather than fixed inner “circuits.”
- **Lecture & slide**: 11-26, slides 639–653 (summary of “constructivist/core affect idea”)  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - A child feeling some unpleasant arousal but not knowing the word “embarrassed” yet; as they learn language and concepts, they begin to label and interpret that same core affect as “embarrassment” in certain contexts.  
- **Related**: [Circumplex Model of Affect](#circumplex-model-of-affect), [Appraisal Theories (Emotion)](#appraisal-theories-emotion), [Visceral Signals](#visceral-signals)

## Dominance (Face Evaluation)

- **Definition**: One of the primary dimensions in the 2D evaluation of faces, reflecting perceived **capacity to enact intentions**—how strong, formidable, or imposing a person appears.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: “Can this person carry out what they intend to do to me?”
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-17 (Part 3: Lecture 3 – External Signals: Social Perception), slides on the “2D Face Evaluation Model” (Oosterhof & Todorov): Trustworthiness × Dominance.  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - A face that resembles anger (furrowed brows, tight lips) is judged as more dominant and thus more capable of harm.  
- **Related**: [Trustworthiness (Face Evaluation)](#trustworthiness-face-evaluation), [Social Perception (Impressions from Faces)](#social-perception-impressions-from-faces), [Stereotype Content Model](#stereotype-content-model)

---

## Electrodermal Synchrony

- **Definition**: Correlated changes in **skin conductance** (electrodermal activity) between two people over time, reflecting shared autonomic arousal during a common experience.

- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-26, slides 74–91 (expression synchrony and electrodermal synchrony predicting connection)  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - Two strangers watching the same emotional TV show whose skin conductance peaks at the same moments; higher synchrony predicts feeling more connected afterwards.  
- **Related**: [Synchrony (Interpersonal)](#synchrony-interpersonal), [Visceral Signals](#visceral-signals), [Collective Memory](#collective-memory)

---

## Emotion Recognition (from Faces)

- **Definition**: The task of inferring emotional categories (e.g., happiness, anger, fear) from facial configurations, either by human observers or by automated models.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: Turning patterns of muscles in the face into “best-guess emotion labels.”
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-21, slides 21–23, 115–151 (“How good are humans at detecting facial expressions?” / “How good are machines…?”)  
  - 11-24, slides 242–262 (“How good are machines…” and cultural variation)  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - A model that labels an image as “happy” because the mouth corners are raised and cheeks lifted; a human observer doing essentially the same thing implicitly.  
- **Related**: [Facial Action Coding System (FACS)](#facial-action-coding-system-facs), [Affective Computing](#affective-computing), [Universal Facial Expressions](#universal-facial-expressions)

---

## Facial Action Coding System (FACS)

- **Definition**: A descriptive coding system that maps **observable facial muscle movements** into “Action Units” (AUs) and codes any expression as a combination of these units.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: A “periodic table” of facial muscle movements that lets you write any expression as AU-numbers instead of emotion words.
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-21, slide 22 (“Facial Muscles & Action Units”) and slides ~71–85 (“How machines ‘see’ faces”)

## First Impressions

- **Definition**: Rapid, often automatic judgments about a person (e.g., trustworthiness, competence) made from limited information such as a single face or thin slice of behavior—often within ~200 ms.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: Your brain’s “fast-take” on someone before you’ve had time to think.
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-17, slides on “Impressions from Faces” and the 200 ms time-course curve for face judgments.

---

## High-Dimensional Model of Social Impressions

- **Definition**: A modeling approach (e.g., Todorov, Peterson, Cikara) that represents impressions of faces as points in a **high-dimensional feature space** (rather than just two dimensions like trustworthiness and dominance), learned from large datasets of faces and human ratings.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: A richer “map” of face impressions where many subtle traits and combinations (warmth, weirdness, attractiveness, etc.) can be represented simultaneously.
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-21, slides 21–24 (“Classic low-dimensional theories” vs “High-dimensional model”; Cikara et al., 2022)  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - Using a deep generative model to show how gradually sliding along one dimension changes perceived “friendliness,” while sliding along another changes perceived “competence,” and both combine to approximate people’s subjective ratings.

## Minimal Group Paradigm

- **Definition**: An experimental paradigm (Tajfel, 1971) where people are randomly assigned to arbitrary groups (e.g., based on coin flips or bogus surveys), yet still show **in-group favoritism** and biased judgments toward out-groups.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: “Us vs. them in the lab with completely meaningless group labels.”

- **Related**: [Social Groups](#social-groups), [Social Categories](#social-categories), [Out-Group Homogeneity Effect](#out-group-homogeneity-effect), [Transitivity](#transitivity)

---

## Mood as Information

- **Definition**: The idea (Schwarz & Clore, 1983) that people unintentionally use their **current mood as a heuristic** when making judgments (e.g., life satisfaction), unless they attribute that mood to some other cause (like the weather).  
- **Other ways to think about it**: Treating “how I feel right now” as evidence about “how good things are,” even when the feeling is caused by something irrelevant.
- **Lecture & slide**: 12-01, slides 136–157 (mood as information; weather and life satisfaction; shopping while hungry)  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - People reporting higher life satisfaction on sunny days than rainy days—unless you first ask them about the weather, which “explains away” their mood and removes the effect.  
  - Buying too much food when you shop hungry because current visceral hunger gets treated as if “future me” will be that hungry too.  
- **Related**: [Visceral Signals](#visceral-signals), [Affect](#affect), [Categorization (Perception as an Act of Categorization)](#categorization-perception-as-an-act-of-categorization)

---

## Out-Group Homogeneity Effect

- **Definition**: The tendency to perceive members of an **out-group** as more similar to one another (“they’re all the same”) while seeing one’s **in-group** as more diverse and individuated.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: Collapsing all “them” into a single stereotype while preserving nuanced differences among “us.”
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-14, slides summarizing Allen & Wilder (1979): less diversity in out-group predictions, “rich diversity” for in-group predictions.  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - Predicting that “most people in that other group like the same artwork for the same reasons” but giving more varied and individualized explanations for people in your own group.  
- **Related**: [Stereotypes](#stereotypes), [Social Categories](#social-categories), [Minimal Group Paradigm](#minimal-group-paradigm)

---

## Physiognomy

- **Definition**: The (historically recurring) belief that you can infer a person’s **true character, criminality, or personality** directly and objectively from their facial structure or appearance. Modern versions involve using AI to “detect” traits like criminality or sexual orientation from faces.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: Treating face-based stereotypes as ground truth, rather than as subjective impressions.
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-19 (Part 3: Lecture 4 – AI Impressions & Physiognomy), discussion of Lombroso, historical physiognomy, and modern AI claims about criminality and sexual orientation.  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - An Israeli startup claiming to detect “terrorists” or “pedophiles” from a single face image; modern AI papers claiming to classify sexual orientation from headshots.

---

## Placebo Effect (Socially Transmitted Placebo)

- **Definition**: Changes in symptoms (e.g., pain) that arise **because of beliefs and expectations** about a treatment rather than the treatment’s pharmacological action—here, transmitted socially from a “doctor” to a “patient” via facial expressions and interaction.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: Your body responding to what you *think* a drug will do, especially when another person’s behavior quietly reinforces that belief.
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-24, slides 180–231 (DBS example and psychotherapy outcome breakdown), 202–221 (Thermedol vs control; belief transmission phases; summary bullet “Facial expressions…socially transmit placebo effects”).  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - In the Thermedol study, patients receive identical heat stimulation regardless of cream, but report **less pain**, show reduced pain-like facial expressions, and lower autonomic responses when their doctor believes Thermedol is more effective.

- **Other ways to think about it**: “You are who you think other people think you are.”
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 12-01, slides 181–193 (three views of the self; “looking-glass self”), and fMRI results showing vmPFC patterns for self vs friends thinking about you.  
- **Example(s)**:  
  - Friends consistently describe you as “organized,” and over time you internalize this and begin to see yourself that way—even changing behavior to align with it.  
- **Related**: [Self as an Internal Schema](#self-as-an-internal-schema), [Self as Causal Narrative](#self-as-causal-narrative), [Social Categories](#social-categories)

---

## Self as Causal Narrative

- **Definition**: A view of the self as the **sequence of causal connections** you construct between your traits and memories—like an editable movie of your life—shaped by your social world and feedback.

---

## Social Groups

- **Definition**: Sets of individuals perceived to share a common identity, fate, or norms (e.g., Eagles vs Rattlers, in-group vs out-group), which profoundly shape conflict, cooperation, and stereotyping.  
- **Other ways to think about it**: The “us” and “them” that structure our social world—even when the grouping is arbitrary.

- **Other ways to think about it**: Mental shortcuts that treat “group label” as informative about “what an individual is like.”
- **Lecture & slide**:  
  - 11-14, slides “Stereotypes” (trade-offs; inaccurate in diverse & changing environments; not useful for guiding actions toward individuals).  
  - 11-17, slides on stereotyping as a heuristic operating over trait and warmth/competence spaces.
