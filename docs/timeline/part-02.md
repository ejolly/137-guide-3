# Evolution of Rationality

*(See lectures 10-20, 10-24, 10-27)*

## Axiomatic Rationality

**Time period:** Early–mid 20th c. foundations for “rational choice” in uncertain environments.  
**Perspective:** If a decision maker’s preferences satisfy a small set of axioms, their choices can be represented as maximizing a numerical quantity (utility).  
**Core axioms:** Completeness, Transitivity, Independence, Continuity.  
**Notable Figure(s):** von Neumann & Morgenstern (formalization), Savage (subjective expected utility); see our slides framing these as EUT’s backbone.  
**Example:** If you prefer A to B and B to C, axioms imply you must prefer A to C (transitivity).  
**Related Concepts:** Normative vs. Descriptive theories (EUT is normative; Prospect Theory is descriptive).  

## Statistical Decision Theory 

**Time period:** 18th–19th c. → modern probability & gambling math (then 20th-c. decision theory).  
**Perspective:** “Rational” = maximize Expected Value (EV)—the long-run average payoff. EV is computed by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing.  
**Notable Figure(s):** Pascal, Fermat, Bernoulli (early probability & utility ideas).  
**Example:** A coin flip paying $2 for heads and $0 for tails has EV = $1; a “fair bet” is priced at the EV.  
**Related Concepts:** Expected Value Theory (maximize dollars), which our notes contrast with Expected Utility (maximize psychological value)  

## Expected Utility Theory

**Time period:** 18th c. (Bernoulli) → 20th c. axiomatization.  
**Perspective:** People maximize Expected Utility (EU), not money—outcomes are first converted by a utility function that captures subjective value (e.g., diminishing marginal utility). Mathematically it’s EV with a “U(·)” transformation.  
**Notable Figure(s):** Daniel Bernoulli; von Neumann & Morgenstern.  
**Example:** Choosing a sure $400 over a 50% chance at $1000 can be EU-maximizing if your utility function is concave.  
**Related Concepts:** Utility, Utility Function, Axioms of EUT, EV vs. EU distinction.  

## Homo-Economicus

**Time period:** Mid-20th c. ideal man    
**Perspective:** The idealized “economic man” has perfect information, unlimited computation, and always optimizes (consistent with EUT). Our lecture contrasted this outcome-maximizer view with later process-level views.  
**Notable Figure(s):** Classical & neoclassical economists; popularized in rational choice models.  
**Example:** Treating biases as “errors” relative to a mathematically optimal benchmark.  
**Related Concepts:** Normative model; baseline for later shifts (Prospect Theory, Resource Rationality).  

## Prospect Theory

**Time period:** 1970s (Kahneman & Tversky) c. real people    
**Perspective:** Real people transform outcomes with a value function (concave for gains, convex for losses, steeper for losses → loss aversion), and transform probabilities with a weighting function (overweight small p, underweight large p). It’s a descriptive theory of how people actually choose.  
**Notable Figure(s):** Daniel Kahneman (2002 Nobel), Amos Tversky.  
**Example:** Framing effect—risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses (Asian Disease-style choices). Certainty effect—overweight sure outcomes. Ambiguity aversion—avoid unknown odds.  
**Related Concepts:** Reference dependence, anchoring, availability/representativeness, bridge to Behavioral Economics.  

## Resource/Ecological Rationality

**Time period:** 1990s → present (Simon’s legacy; Lieder & Griffiths; Gigerenzer)
**Perspective:** Human cognition is bounded (time, information, computation). Good decision-making = maximize the expected utility of cognition, trading off accuracy vs. effort given the structure of the environment (Simon’s “scissors”: person × environment). In short: rational within bounds.  
**Notable Figure(s):** Herbert Simon (bounded rationality), Lieder & Griffiths (resource-rational analysis), Gigerenzer (ecological rationality)  
**Example(s):**  Recipe for resource rationality (problem → resources → candidate strategies → trade-offs → bounded-optimal pick). In social dilemmas, direct reciprocity and simple contingent strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat) are bounded-optimal in repeated settings (“shadow of the future”).  
**Related Concepts:** Bounded optimality, trade-off thinking, rational analysis, Homo-heuristicus  

## Homo-Heuristicus 

**Time period:** 2000s → present (Gigerenzer; fast-and-frugal heuristics).  
**Perspective:** People use simple heuristics (satisficing, fluency, social learning) that fit ecological structure; these can be more adaptive than complex optimization under real-world constraints. Focus shifts from optimal outcomes to processes and goals under limits.  
**Notable Figure(s):** Gerd Gigerenzer; also connects to our course thread on process > outcomes.  
**Example:** Satisficing—choose the first option that clears a threshold when time/effort are scarce; fluency—prefer options that are easier to process; copy/imitate under uncertainty (social learning).  
**Related Concepts:** Ecological rationality, bounded optimality, resource rationality (heuristics as adaptive strategies, not errors).  

## How they Connect

**From axioms to people:** EUT’s axioms justify a normative ideal (what a perfectly rational agent should do), but humans show reliable descriptive patterns (Prospect Theory).  

**From money to mind:** EV maximizes dollars; EU maximizes psychological value via a utility function (why the same $ can matter differently to different people).  

**From errors to adaptation:** “Biases” (loss aversion, anchoring, availability) often reflect ecologically sensible shortcuts under constraints—Homo-heuristicus.  

**From solo choice to social choice:** In repeated interactions (PD, PGG), simple contingent strategies (be nice, retaliatory, forgiving, clear) stabilize cooperation—an instance of bounded optimality in social environments.  

**Trade-offs mindset:** Resource-rational analysis = define the task, limits, and strategies; then pick the best trade-off (time × accuracy × effort).
