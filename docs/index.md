# Challenge 2 Study Guide

This site contains several additional resources to help you prepare for Challenge 2. You should treat this as a *supplemental resource* to lecture slides, attendance & podcasts.

!> These resources are **not comprehensive** and should serve as a general starting point and/or refresher. Make sure to refer to the actual lectures for details that might be missing here. "It wasn't in the study guide" won't be an acceptable excuse!

?> Full lecture slides, podcasts, paper PDFs, & videos are available on [Canvas](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/70082).

## Suggested uses

There are few ways you might find it helpful to review this material:

- Start with the [evolution of rationality](timeline/part-02) and then revisit [lecture notes](lecture-notes/part-02)
- Start with the [glossary](glossary/part-02) and treat it like wikipedia. Jump around to different [papers](paper-summaries/part-02) and [lecture notes](lecture-notes/part-02) for more context
- Or just use whatever study methods work for you and use the *search box* to find anything in the guide you're looking for

## AI study help (optional)

You might also find it helpful to *chat* with all lecture materials and transcripts from Part 2 of the course using the optional course NotebookLM:

- All Part 2 lecture recordings: [https://tinyurl.com/137-part-2](https://tinyurl.com/137-part-2)

<!--Canvas also includes an "AI-lecture-recaps" Module that has brief (5-7min) refresher videos based on full lecture transcripts using NotebookLM!

!> AI generate summaries and chats can sometimes be *more* confusing if you're asking about *nuanced details*. When this happens, try asking it to refer to specific lecture slides to force it to explain things in a more *class-consistent* way. However, for the final say always refer directly to lecture slides & podcasts!-->
