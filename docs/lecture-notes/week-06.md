# Part 2 - Week 6 Lecture Notes

## Wed-11-05 Cooperation

**Big Questions.** How does cooperation emerge and persist among self-interested agents? Why is being “nice” or cooperative often the optimal strategy in the long run? How do evolutionary, psychological, and social mechanisms sustain cooperative behavior in humans?

### Key Ideas

* **From Game Theory to Cooperation:** Builds directly from the *Prisoner’s Dilemma* and *Axelrod’s Tournament* (Axelrod, 1981). In repeated interactions, purely selfish (defect-defect) strategies—although mathematically optimal—fail to maximize collective or even long-term individual outcomes.
* **Shadow of the Future:** The potential for future encounters fundamentally alters optimal behavior. Agents consider the long-term consequences of current actions, which encourages cooperation.
* **Tit-for-Tat (TFT):** A simple and highly successful strategy in repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma tournaments.

  * *Nice*: Never defects first.
  * *Forgiving*: Returns to cooperation after retaliation.
  * *Clear*: Behavior is transparent and predictable.
  * *Retaliatory*: Punishes defection immediately.
* **Direct Reciprocity:** Future consequences exist for present behavior—*“If you do not cooperate with me today, I will not cooperate with you tomorrow.”* Cooperation is maintained by conditional responses across repeated encounters.
* **Empirical Evidence:**

  * *Mao et al. (2017)* – “Resilient cooperators” stabilize long-run cooperation across repeated games of Prisoner’s Dilemma.
  * *Blake et al. (2015)* – Even 10-year-old children naturally use TFT-like strategies in repeated social games, demonstrating developmental roots of conditional cooperation.
* **Conditional Cooperation as Optimal:** From a *bounded* or *resource-rational* perspective, cooperating when future interaction is possible is evolutionarily adaptive and cognitively efficient. Humans evolved in environments characterized by repeated interactions and social interdependence.

### Lecture Notes

* **Axelrod Tournament Recap:** Simulated 200 rounds of the Prisoner’s Dilemma among competing strategies. TFT dominated because it leveraged repeated interactions and reciprocity to maintain cooperation.
* **Direct Reciprocity Mechanism:** Cooperation incurs short-term costs but yields long-term rewards. TFT enforces cooperation not through punishment, but through *denial of future benefits* to defectors.
* **Human and Developmental Data:** Studies (e.g., Mao et al., Blake et al.) confirm that both adults and children exhibit default conditional cooperation—responding in kind to others’ cooperation or defection.
* **Bounded Rationality Revisited:** Being “nice” is not naive—it’s the *bounded-optimal* response in social environments with repeated interactions (Simon, 1990; Rand & Nowak, 2013). Rationality is shaped by ecological context, not by formal mathematical ideals.
* **From Two Players to Many:** Extends the logic of PD to the *Public Goods Game (PGG)*—a group-based dilemma where individual contributions benefit everyone.

  * Captures the *Tragedy of the Commons* (Hardin, 1968): short-term individual gain vs. long-term collective welfare.

### Highlights

* **Key Concept:** “Nice = Optimal” whenever the probability of future interaction (P[future interaction] > 0).
* **Core Terms:** *Direct Reciprocity*, *Conditional Cooperation*, *Tit-for-Tat*, *Bounded Optimality*, *Shadow of the Future*.
* **Readings:** Axelrod (1981); Rand & Nowak (2013); Mao et al. (2017); Blake et al. (2015).

## Public Goods Game

**Big Questions.** How can cooperation scale from dyads to groups? What mechanisms sustain collective contributions when free-riding is possible?

### Key Ideas

* **Structure of PGG:** A “scaled-up” Prisoner’s Dilemma.

  1. More than two players.
  2. Repeated interactions.
  3. Continuous cooperation—participants decide how much to contribute (money, tokens, effort).
* **Game Dynamics:** Each player contributes to a group pool, which is multiplied (e.g., doubled) and evenly redistributed to all players, regardless of contribution.

  * *Cooperators* contribute to the pool.
  * *Defectors* contribute nothing but still receive benefits.
* **Empirical Finding:** Cooperation declines (“unravels”) over repeated rounds—individuals gradually reduce contributions as they see others free-ride.
* **Punishment as a Norm-Enforcing Mechanism:**

  * *Fehr & Gächter (2002):* Allowing participants to pay to punish defectors restores cooperation by enforcing social norms—how individuals *ought* to act.
  * Punishment operates via *indirect reciprocity*: agents incur personal costs to uphold fairness and group-level cooperation.
* **Spreading Cooperation Without Punishment:**

  * *Fowler & Christakis (2010):* Cooperative behavior diffuses through social networks up to *three degrees of separation* and persists over time, even without explicit punishment.
  * About 20–30% of individuals behaving cooperatively can sustain long-term cooperation in the population.
* **Evolutionary Implications:** Repeated interactions, observation, and social structure allow cooperation to spread beyond direct reciprocity.

### Lecture Notes

* **From PD to PGG:** The PGG generalizes dyadic cooperation to group-level dilemmas where outcomes depend on collective contribution.
* **Tragedy of the Commons:** Individuals face a tension between exploiting shared resources for personal gain and preserving them for future collective benefit.
* **Empirical Results:** Cooperation decays over time, but mechanisms like punishment and social contagion can counteract the decline.
* **Social Norm Enforcement:** Punishment sustains cooperation by aligning behavior with shared expectations of fairness. Though costly, it enhances group stability.
* **Cooperation Cascades:** Cooperative acts propagate across networks via observational learning and reputation effects (Fowler & Christakis, 2010). Even partial cooperation can stabilize systems.
* **Direct vs. Indirect Reciprocity:**

  * *Direct reciprocity:* Repeated interactions between the same individuals.
  * *Indirect reciprocity:* Reputation effects—cooperation spreads when others observe and imitate cooperative acts.

### Highlights

* **Visuals:** Public Goods Game diagrams (Slides 19–22); Fehr & Gächter (2002) showing punishment restores cooperation.
* **Core Terms:** *Tragedy of the Commons*, *Public Goods Game*, *Indirect Reciprocity*, *Social Norms*, *Reputation*, *Conditional Cooperation*.
* **Readings:** Fehr & Gächter (2002); Fowler & Christakis (2010); Mao et al. (2017); Blake et al. (2015).

## Evolutionary Dynamics of Cooperation

**Big Questions.** How do cooperative behaviors evolve and persist in populations over time? What environmental and social factors shape these dynamics?

### Key Ideas

* **Beyond Direct Reciprocity:** Multiple selection pressures contribute to the evolution and stability of cooperation (Rand & Nowak, 2013):

  1. **Direct Reciprocity:** Repeated interactions between the same partners.
  2. **Indirect Reciprocity:** Reputation-based cooperation—others observe and learn from interactions.
  3. **Spatial Selection:** Environments cluster similar strategies, promoting local cooperation (“birds of a feather”).
  4. **Multi-level Selection:** Groups with more cooperators outcompete selfish groups.
  5. **Kin Selection:** Cooperation evolves through genetic relatedness—favoring individuals who share genes.
* **Resource Rationality Perspective:** Cooperation is *bounded-optimal*—maximizing long-term survival given limited cognitive and social resources.
* **Context Matters:** Cognitive architecture and environmental structure (Simon’s Scissors) jointly determine the adaptive shape of cooperation.

### Lecture Notes

* **Ecological Framing:** Repeated, observable, and kin-based interactions shape cooperative behavior. Humans are adapted to thrive in structured social environments that reward reciprocity and norm-following.
* **Social Network Effects:** Cooperation spreads through both time and social distance, reinforcing group cohesion.
* **From Homo Economicus → Homo Heuristicus → Homo Cooperativus:** Rationality evolves from self-interest to social interest, integrating adaptation, bounded cognition, and collective benefit.

### Highlights

* **Key Model:** Evolutionary pathways—direct, indirect, spatial, group, and kin selection (Slide 26–27).
* **Core Concepts:** *Indirect Reciprocity*, *Spatial Selection*, *Group Selection*, *Kin Selection*, *Bounded Optimality*.
* **Readings:** Rand & Nowak (2013); Fehr & Gächter (2002); Fowler & Christakis (2010); Mao et al. (2017).

### Week 6 Summary

* Cooperation emerges not from perfect rationality, but from *boundedly optimal adaptation* to social environments.
* Simple, transparent, and forgiving strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat) outperform complex, exploitative ones.
* Group-level dynamics—punishment, reputation, and imitation—stabilize cooperation beyond dyads.
* Theories of decision-making converge on the idea that humans are *resource-rational cooperators*: we maximize long-term social utility within the constraints of cognition and context.
