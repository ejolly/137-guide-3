## Mon-10-20 The Logic of Choice

**Big Questions.** How do humans make decisions under uncertainty? What does it mean to be *rational*? How do theories like Expected Value, Expected Utility, and Prospect Theory explain patterns of judgment and choice?

### Key Ideas

* **From Mind Perception to Decision-Making:** Transition from how we *see minds* to how we *think and decide*—linking perception, reasoning, and behavior.
* **Framing Effects:** Identical outcomes framed as gains vs. losses evoke different preferences (e.g., saving vs. dying). Demonstrated using the **Asian Disease Problem** from Tversky & Kahneman (1981), where people were risk-averse in gain frames but risk-seeking in loss frames.
* **Bounded Rationality (Herbert Simon):** Humans are not perfectly rational calculators; instead, we use limited information and time to make *satisficing* (good-enough) decisions. Rationality is constrained by the environment and cognitive resources.
* **Simon’s Scissors Metaphor:** Rational behavior results from the interaction between the **structure of the environment** and **the computational capabilities of the actor**—two blades of a pair of scissors shaping each other.
* **Evolutionary Context:** Cognition evolved to solve real-world adaptive problems, not abstract logic puzzles. Rationality must be understood as *ecological*—fit for the environment in which it developed.
* **Revisiting Rationality:** Historically, rationality meant internal consistency and logical coherence; modern views include adaptation and bounded optimality.

### Lecture Notes

* **Framing & Risk Preferences:** We compared life-and-death scenarios framed as gains (saving lives) vs. losses (people dying). This highlighted *loss aversion* and *risk-seeking vs. risk-averse* tendencies central to **Prospect Theory**.
* **Expected Value Theory (EV):** The earliest model of rational decision-making—people maximize the long-run average payoff (probability × outcome). However, this assumes objective, repeatable outcomes (e.g., gambling), not subjective value.
* **Expected Utility Theory (EUT):** Introduced *utility* to capture subjective satisfaction or psychological value rather than monetary reward. Choices aim to maximize *expected utility*, acknowledging diminishing returns (concave utility curve). Relates to **Bernoulli (1738)** and forms the basis of normative decision theory.
* **Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979):** Real humans deviate from EUT—they evaluate outcomes relative to a **reference point** (e.g., current state) and weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains (**loss aversion**). Small probabilities are overweighted, explaining lottery and insurance behavior.
* **Connecting to Bounded Rationality:** Simon (1990) emphasized that rationality is limited by computation and context. Decision strategies emerge from an interaction of mind and environment, not from idealized optimization.
* **Rational Analysis (John Anderson):** Minds are adaptive systems evolved to solve environmental demands—rationality should be defined relative to those problems, not abstract ideals.
* **Resource Rationality:** Modern synthesis (Lieder & Griffiths, 2020)—humans make the *best possible use of limited resources* by optimizing the trade-off between accuracy and cognitive cost.

### Highlights

* **Herbert Simon’s Scissors:** Rationality = f(Context × Cognition).
* **Key Terms:** *Expected Value Theory*, *Expected Utility Theory*, *Prospect Theory*, *Bounded Rationality*, *Resource Rationality.*
* **Readings:** Simon (1990) on bounded rationality; Kahneman & Tversky (1979) on Prospect Theory; Lieder & Griffiths (2020) on resource rationality.

## Fri-10-24 Statistical Decision Theory

**Big Questions.** How did early theories of rationality evolve from mathematical gambling models to psychological accounts of subjective value and adaptive reasoning?

### Key Ideas

* **Statistical Decision Theory:** Originated from 18th–19th century gambling mathematics; “rational” players maximize *expected value*—the long-run average reward across repeated plays.
* **Expected Value (EV):** Multiply each outcome by its probability and sum them. Assumes objective rewards and infinite repetitions.
* **Limits of EV:** Psychological value ≠ monetary value. People care about *utility*—how outcomes feel—not just numerical averages.
* **Expected Utility Theory (EUT):** Extends EV by introducing a subjective utility function. Rational agents maximize expected utility rather than expected value. The **utility curve** is concave, showing diminishing marginal returns (each dollar means less as wealth grows).
* **Axioms of EUT:** Rational choices follow four assumptions—**completeness**, **transitivity**, **independence**, and **continuity**—which guarantee consistent preferences and define a utility function.
* **Empirical Deviations:** People systematically violate EUT; they prefer certain smaller gains over probabilistic larger ones (certainty effect), revealing *risk aversion* and *subjective weighting* of probabilities.
* **From EUT to Prospect Theory:** These violations motivated Kahneman & Tversky’s descriptive model—adding reference dependence and nonlinear probability weighting.
* **Connection to Bounded & Resource Rationality:** Simon’s framework reminds us that rationality is not fixed but shaped by constraints and environmental structure. Resource Rationality formalizes this as optimization under computational costs.

### Lecture Notes

* **Historical Context:** Mathematical “probability revolution” emerged from gambling—Pascal, Fermat, and Bernoulli sought formulas for fair bets. Rationality meant maximizing *expected value*.
* **Example Problem:** Coin-flip game—$2 for heads, $0 for tails—EV = $1 per play. This defines “fairness” but ignores psychological meaning of risk.
* **Transition to EUT:** Daniel Bernoulli proposed that satisfaction (utility) grows slower than wealth; the same gain matters more when poor than when rich. Introduced *subjective value*.
* **Utility Function Visualization:** Slides showed concave utility curves—steep for low wealth, flattening for high wealth—demonstrating diminishing returns.
* **EUT Axioms Recap:**

  * *Completeness:* You can compare any two options.
  * *Transitivity:* Preferences are consistent.
  * *Independence:* Adding irrelevant options shouldn’t change choices.
  * *Continuity:* Mixtures of options yield predictable satisfaction.
* **Early Behavioral Evidence:** When offered a sure $400 vs. a 50% chance at $1000, most people choose the sure gain—even though the gamble’s EV ($500) is higher. The *certainty effect* illustrates subjective utility.
* **Bridging to Psychology:** Theories of decision-making evolved from idealized math toward cognitive models accounting for perception, emotion, and adaptation. Human rationality reflects bounded optimization in ecological contexts.

### Highlights

* **Visuals:** Concave utility curve showing diminishing marginal utility (slides 20–22).
* **Major Takeaways:** Rationality evolved from logic → probability → utility → adaptation.
* **Readings:** Kahneman & Tversky (1979) on Prospect Theory; Simon (1990) on bounded rationality; Lieder & Griffiths (2020) on resource-rational analysis.

### Week 4 Summary

* Rationality has evolved from **formal logic** → **expected value** → **expected utility** → **prospect theory** → **rational/resource rationality**.
* Human decision-making reflects adaptation to cognitive and environmental constraints rather than perfect optimization.
* These frameworks connect economics, psychology, and neuroscience through Marr’s levels of analysis: *what*, *how*, and *why* cognition works as it does.
