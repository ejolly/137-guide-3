## Mon-11-24 Affective Synchrony and Social Signal Processing
**Big Questions.** How do facial expressions and physiological signals synchronize during shared experiences to create feelings of social connection? Can social signals transmit beliefs and expectations between people powerfully enough to alter physical experiences like pain?

### Key Ideas
- **Facial Action Coding System (FACS):** A taxonomy mapping anatomical facial muscles to facial configurations, used as the foundation for all computer vision emotion detection systems. These systems learn human-like subjective judgments, not objective truth.
- **Affective Synchrony:** The temporal alignment of facial expressions, physiological states, and emotional experiences between individuals during shared experiences, which predicts increasing social connection over time.
- **Social Signal Processing:** Treating facial expressions not as readouts of discrete emotions, but as communicative signals that reflect both internal states and social communication goals (intentional or unintentional).
- **Socially Transmitted Placebo Effect:** The phenomenon where one person's beliefs (e.g., a doctor's belief about treatment efficacy) can be conveyed through subtle social signals like facial expressions, altering another person's subjective experience and physiological responses.

### Lecture Notes
- **FACS and AI Systems:**
  - The Facial Action Coding System maps anatomical muscles (e.g., zygomaticus major for smiling) to facial configurations
  - This human-created taxonomy forms the foundation of all computer vision systems for detecting facial expressions
  - AI models fundamentally learn human-like subjective judgments, not ground truth about emotions
  - We can use AI models as tools to unpack complex aspects of social cognition rather than as superhuman detectors of truth
  - Example: Instead of labeling faces with discrete emotions, models can identify which facial configurations best predict human judgments in context (e.g., good news vs. bad news)

- **Study 1: Affective Synchrony and Social Connection (Cheong et al.):**
  - **Design:** Pairs of strangers watched four TV episodes together while wearing GoPro face cameras and physiological sensors
  - **Comparison:** Actual pairs watching together vs. randomly paired individuals who watched separately
  - **Measurements:** Facial expressions via FACS, electrodermal activity (skin conductance), self-reported social connection, and impressions of show content
  - **Key Finding:** Without assuming universal expressions, researchers extracted facial signals that synchronized across individuals watching together
  - Two broad expression patterns emerged based on data-driven analysis: one related to eye-raising muscles, another to jaw/pouting movements
  - **Results:** Synchrony in these expressions increased episode-by-episode, correlating with increasing feelings of connection between participants
  - **Interpretation:** Multiple synchronous processes (facial, physiological, narrative understanding) combine to create experiences of shared affection and interpersonal affiliation
  - People weren't talking, just watching together—yet synchrony in how they emoted was enough to shape how connected they felt

- **Study 2: Socially Transmitted Placebo Effects (Chen & colleagues):**
  - **Context:** Medical settings demonstrate the power of belief (double-blind trials exist because belief shapes treatment efficacy)
  - **Design:** Mock doctor-patient interactions using heat pain stimulation
  - **Phase 1 (Conditioning):** "Doctors" received two identical Vaselines (labeled ThermaControl and Thermadol) paired with different temperatures, creating the belief that one was more effective
  - **Phase 2 (Transmission):** Doctors applied both treatments to "patients" while believing one was superior
  - **Critical manipulation:** Patients received identical temperature stimulation regardless of which "treatment" they got; doctors couldn't explicitly tell patients which was which (mimicking double-blind protocols)
  - **Results:**
    - Patients reported less pain when receiving the treatment doctors believed was effective
    - Patients showed reduced pain-related facial expressions (wincing)
    - Autonomic nervous system responses (uncontrollable physiological signals) decreased
    - Patients acquired doctors' beliefs through subtle facial expression differences
    - Patients rated doctors as more empathic when doctors believed in the treatment
  - **Implication:** Facial expressions can transmit beliefs between people, altering subjective experiences and involuntary physiological responses

- **Facial Expressions as Social Signals:**
  - Expressions reflect a mixture of internal states and communicative signals (intentional or not)
  - This dual nature means expressions serve both physiological and social functions
  - When expressions synchronize or adapt during interactions, they fundamentally alter both personal feelings and impressions of others
  - Synchrony forms building blocks for lasting relationships, larger-scale social bonds, and coordination
  - The capacity to detect another mind (Part 1 of course) leads naturally to assessing whether that mind resonates with yours

- **Universality Question:**
  - The difficult part of "universal facial expression" isn't "facial expression"—it's defining "universal"
  - Meta-analyses show robust cross-cultural consistency: people recognize facial configurations above chance even from unfamiliar cultures
  - However, systematic differences exist—higher accuracy for expressions from familiar cultures (in-group advantage)
  - This reflects **bounded rationality**: adaptive expertise develops for faces and situations with real consequences for your life
  - Barrett et al.'s key argument: facial expressions are one signal among many, and context effects often exceed face effects
  - When expressions are presented with contextual information, context dominates interpretation (face + body/situation)
  - Most people use faces as one part of broader situational context, not as isolated signals

- **Integrating Context:**
  - Pure facial signal is lower than typically assumed when context is included
  - We're bounded by our environment—we integrate what's happening around the face as much as what's on it
  - Visual context (body posture, scene) serves as integrated information for emotion recognition
  - In everyday life, faces are small signals among many other signals we're constantly attuned to
  - Studies breaking people into groups by interpretation strategies find the smallest group are those who only use the face

### Highlights
- **Synchrony as relationship foundation:** The synchronization of facial expressions and physiological states during shared experiences (even passive ones like watching TV) predicts growing social connection, suggesting these signals form the foundation of interpersonal bonds
- **Facial expressions transmit beliefs:** Doctor-patient study demonstrates that subtle facial expressions can transmit beliefs powerfully enough to alter physical pain experience, autonomic responses, and perceived empathy—revealing expressions as potent social signals, not just emotion readouts
- **Context dominates face perception:** While cross-cultural consistency exists, contextual information (body, situation, eliciting events) typically has larger effects on interpretation than the face itself, challenging universality claims that ignore situated cognition
- **AI reflects human judgment, not truth:** Computer vision emotion detection systems learn from FACS, which itself is a human taxonomy of subjective judgments—there is no "ground truth" emotion, only culturally-shaped, context-dependent interpretations
- **From mind detection to synchrony:** Course integration—detecting minds (Part 1) naturally leads to assessing whether those minds resonate with yours through behavioral/neural synchrony, which in turn promotes social bonding

## Wed-11-26 Emotion Theories and Contextual Processing
**Big Questions.** What do different theories of emotion predict about the relationship between expressions, internal states, and contexts? To what extent do facial expressions reflect universal signals versus culturally-shaped, context-dependent constructions?

### Key Ideas
- **Ancient Americas Emotional Expressions Study:** Archaeological artwork provides a unique test of emotional universality by examining whether modern interpretations of ancient sculptures show consistency with psychological theories, revealing both within-culture consistency and cross-cultural patterns.
- **Context Effects on Expression Interpretation:** The most important factor in interpreting facial expressions on a daily basis is the context in which they're observed—body position, situation, and eliciting events typically have larger effects than the face alone.
- **Basic Emotion Theory vs. Constructed Emotion Theory:** The spectrum of emotion theories ranges from assuming discrete, universal, biologically-evolved emotions with one-to-one expression mappings (Basic Emotion) to moment-by-moment construction from context and concepts without innate modules (Constructed Emotion).
- **Emotion Expression Functions:** Facial expressions serve both physiological functions (internal state reflection) and communicative functions (social signaling), and these can be dissociated—the same configuration may serve different adaptive purposes across contexts.

### Lecture Notes
- **Recap of Previous Lecture:**
  - Facial expressions reflect mixture of internal states and communicative signals
  - When expressions synchronize/adapt during interactions, they shape both self-feelings and impressions of others
  - These signals form mechanisms for social bonds, relationships, and coordination
  - Detecting minds (Part 1) → assessing resonance through synchrony (Part 3)
  - Study 1 (Affective Synchrony): Strangers watching TV together showed increasing facial/physiological synchrony correlating with increasing social connection feelings over four episodes
  - Study 2 (Socially Transmitted Placebo): Doctors' beliefs about fake medicine efficacy transmitted through facial expressions, altering patients' pain reports, expressions, and autonomic responses despite identical stimulation

- **Universality Evidence Revisited:**
  - Cross-cultural recognition studies show bars well above 50% chance across all emotion categories
  - Systematic advantage exists for own-culture faces (blue bars) vs. other-culture faces (green bars)
  - Bounded rationality perspective: adaptive to become expert in faces/expressions with real consequences for your life
  - If you're constantly moving between cultures, you may develop expertise across multiple expression systems
  - Question of universality must be understood through lens of what it enables adaptively, not as absolute truth

- **Ancient Americas Artwork Study:**
  - **Novel approach:** Testing emotion theories without asking participants in controlled lab settings—using historical archaeological record
  - **Method:** Curated large collections of sculptures/artwork from ancient Incan, Mayan, and other Mesoamerican cultures
  - **Question:** If modern Western emotion theories are correct, how much of what we theorize today is consistent with artwork from the past?
  - Collected modern judgments about multiple dimensions: emotions depicted, contexts (fighting, running, working), body poses
  - Used computational modeling to project data into visualizable space showing clustering structure
  - **Results:** High degree of consistency for many (not all) emotions between modern interpretations and ancient depictions—determination, sadness, shame, fear were recognizable
  - **Interactive visualization:** Three-dimensional space where each letter represents different category/artwork piece, showing dimensional scores
  - **Key takeaway:** Not necessarily broadly universal across all cultures, but remarkable consistency in how humans used to depict expressions in contexts and how we interpret them today
  - **Follow-up patterns:** Similar to modern cross-cultural studies—within-culture consistency is higher, slight preferential processing for culturally familiar artwork, but patterns hold across archaeological sites globally
  - **Social signaling implication:** There's enough consistency that we can "communicate with the past and the past can communicate with us"—this couldn't occur without some consistency in social signals of faces, expressions, situations, and contexts

- **Context Dominance in Interpretation:**
  - **Simple demonstration:** Same face in different contexts (body positions) yields different interpretations (winning marathon vs. losing/pain)
  - Modern technology enables more sophisticated manipulations, but core principle remains
  - When faces appear in contexts, context properties overwhelmingly influence interpretation of facial signals
  - **Analogy to language:** Same sentence means different things depending on when/where it's said; context integration changes meaning while words stay constant
  - Facial expressions are one of many noisy cues combined with other information to reason about what's happening, why, and what comes next
  - **Population-level strategies:** When grouping people by interpretation strategies, smallest group consistently uses only face; most use face as one part of broader situation; larger group may overweight face but still uses context
  - Outside laboratory settings, faces are small signals among many others we're constantly attuned to

- **Emotion Theory Landscape:**
  - Scientists fundamentally disagree about what emotions are, how they're experienced, how they're constructed, and what they do
  - Can position theories along two axes:
    - **Surface similarity axis:** How similar are signals for different experiences? (one-to-one mapping vs. variable)
    - **Deep mechanism axis:** Do different emotions serve different adaptive functions/purposes, or similar ones?

  - **Basic Emotion Theory (Inside Out model):**
    - Position: High surface similarity, distinct mechanisms
    - 5-8 basic, biologically-evolved emotions with universal expressions
    - One character = one emotion in the film (Anger is always anger)
    - One-to-one consistency between expression, behavior, and internal state
    - Maybe a few cultural variations, but mostly shared

  - **Semantic Space Theory:**
    - Position: Lower surface similarity, contexts determine mechanisms
    - Not a one-to-one mapping—perhaps 28-30 different mappings
    - Determined by eliciting contexts (people understand what you're doing)
    - That situation reliably evokes certain feelings
    - Ancient Americas study fits here—consistency emerges from context-expression-action relationships

  - **Constructed Emotion Theory (Barrett - "How Emotions Are Made"):**
    - Position: Low surface similarity, no distinct mechanisms
    - No such thing as basic emotions (no discrete anger, sadness, fear, happiness)
    - Moment-by-moment construction: combine all available information with understanding of words/concepts
    - Layer conceptual knowledge ("anger," "sadness") onto internal signals as they occur
    - Example: Small children have feelings but can't describe them; giving them the word shapes future experiences—they have a word to recognize an internal signal
    - **Radical difference** from Basic Emotion Theory
    - Predicts: less consistency in communication; super variable and culturally shaped expressions
    - Can learn categories to communicate, but individual construction yields variability

  - **Appraisal Theory (William James tradition):**
    - Position: Moderate-low surface similarity, constructed mechanisms
    - "You're not afraid of a bear, you're afraid of what happens if you don't run away from it"
    - Emotion is output of considered process: see stimulus → figure out what it means → assess body state → emotion emerges
    - Expressions vary based on how you interpret things
    - Maybe not completely on-the-fly construction (relatively stable recipes), but determined by interpretation and appraisal
    - No innate biological modules

  - **Social Signal/Adaptive Ecology View (Cohen, Keltner, course perspective):**
    - **Position: Center of space—"it depends"**
    - Emotions as adaptive signals based on resource-rational inferences
    - Depends on internal experience you're having
    - Depends on how adaptive expressions are in your context (smile to lie vs. smile to connect)
    - If we meet, might interpret third person very differently based on our histories
    - Rich understanding of particular emotions creates variability (e.g., depression sufferers describe multiple flavors of sadness)
    - Painful smile vs. genuine smile—same configuration, different meanings
    - **Expression-as-color analogy:** Smooth gradients determined by continuous wavelength, but categorical clumps (Roy G. Biv); differs slightly between people but general agreement; not categorical but consistencies in how we arrive at inferences
    - Both construction and consistency operate
    - Evolved over same environment → successful communication suggests theoretical middle ground

  - **Positioning Course Perspective:**
    - Kurt Lewin (Part 1): Behavior = function of person and environment
    - Herb Simon (Part 2): Equation constrained by adaptive contexts
    - Variability exists across people and contexts, but not so different we can't communicate
    - Shared Earth constrains basic situations that can exist
    - Hard to argue we're not somewhere in the center
    - Why might you be angry? Depends on: expectations about course, our relationship, how tired you are, how many people you've seen, first time in this role, etc.

- **Dual Functions Framework:**
  - **Physiological functions:** Things inside you causing certain emoting patterns; adaptive responses (fear → run away)
  - **Communicative functions:** Social signaling to others; why this particular muscle configuration became consistent rather than another?
  - These are not the same—same expression can serve different purposes depending on what you've learned
  - Understanding requires examining both how people experience emotions AND the communicative ecology they inhabit

### Highlights
- **Archaeological evidence for consistency:** Ancient Mesoamerican sculptures show surprising consistency with modern emotion interpretations (determination, fear, sadness), suggesting enough stable signal structure across centuries to enable "communication with the past"—but within-culture familiarity still provides advantages
- **Context overwhelms face in natural settings:** The single most important factor for expression interpretation is context (body, situation, eliciting events); people who rely solely on faces are the smallest interpretation strategy group, revealing faces as one signal integrated with many others
- **Emotion theory space is vast:** Theories range from Basic Emotion (discrete, universal, one-to-one mappings) to Constructed Emotion (no basic emotions, moment-by-moment assembly from concepts and context), with Appraisal, Semantic Space, and Adaptive Signal views occupying intermediate positions
- **Course integrative perspective:** Taking Lewin (person × environment) and Simon (bounded rationality) seriously places emotion understanding in theoretical center—enough variability that individuals differ, enough consistency that communication succeeds, shaped by adaptive contexts and shared evolutionary history
- **Expressions like colors, not categories:** Facial expressions may be more like wavelengths with smooth gradients and culturally-negotiated categorical boundaries (Roy G. Biv) than discrete emotion modules—consistency in inference processes rather than one-to-one mappings

## Mon-12-01 Memory, Mood, and the Self
**Big Questions.** How do internal affective signals (mood, visceral states) influence perception and judgment? What is the self, and how can we understand it through the lens of memory systems, social construction, and causal narratives?

### Key Ideas
- **Circumplex model of affect:** Emotions can be mapped along two dimensions—arousal (energetic vs. drowsy) and valence (positive vs. negative)—providing a framework for categorizing affective states
- **Mood as information:** Affective signals serve as heuristics that influence judgments and decisions, often operating outside conscious awareness (e.g., weather affecting self-reported well-being)
- **Visceral signals:** Internal states like hunger, fear, arousal narrow attention toward resources, increase impulsivity, and are often misattributed to the wrong causes
- **Schematization:** The process of compressing episodic memories into semantic knowledge—abstracted, decontextualized facts and traits built up over time
- **Self as schema:** One view conceptualizes the self as schematized autobiographical memories—the compression of personal experiences into organized knowledge structures
- **Self as social construction:** The "looking glass self" perspective suggests identity is shaped by how we believe others perceive us; neural evidence shows overlap between self-representations and how friends represent us
- **Self as causal narrative:** The self can be understood as a sequence of causally connected traits and memories—like scenes in a movie that can be rearranged to tell different stories

### Lecture Notes

#### Affect and Emotion: Theoretical Landscape
- Continued discussion from previous lecture on **universal facial expressions**
  - Scientists disagree on theories of emotion based on how emotions are conceptualized
  - Two broad functional dimensions: **physiological function** (what purpose the emotion serves internally) and **communicative function** (what signal is broadcast to others)
- Contemporary theories positioned along axes:
  - **One-to-one mapping vs. many-to-many:** Whether each emotion has a unique expression (like Inside Out) or expressions are context-dependent
  - **Constructed vs. evolved mechanisms:** Whether emotions are built from reasoning about signals or emerge from evolved neural systems
- Modern computational theories take middle ground: emotions are like colors—we can agree on certain things for communication, but individual experiences vary

#### Circumplex Model of Affect
- **Core dimensions of affective experience:**
  - **Arousal:** Excitability of internal state (high arousal = energetic, activated; low arousal = sleepy, drowsy)
  - **Valence:** Positivity/negativity of the signal
- This two-dimensional space allows categorizing typical emotion words as mixtures of arousal and valence interpretations
- Emotions understood as **internal signals** that the brain reasons about

#### Mood as Information and Heuristic
- **Mood:** A summary of internal states (arousal, valence, goals, physiology, heart rate)
- Acts as a **heuristic** influencing judgments and evaluations about the world and other people
- Classic study: Phone calls to participants on sunny vs. cloudy days
  - Strong correlation between weather and self-reported well-being
  - When participants were asked to attend to weather ("How's your mood been today?"), the effect disappeared
  - **Implication:** External environment shapes internal mood without awareness; drawing attention to the signal changes judgments
- Familiar example: Grocery shopping while hungry leads to overbuying
  - You understand what's happening but behave that way regardless
  - Demonstrates affect as heuristic during decision-making

#### Visceral Signals and Decision-Making
- Work by **George Loewenstein** on visceral signals (hunger, fear, arousal)
- **Effects of visceral signals:**
  - Narrow attention and focus toward resources
  - Increase impulsivity (less planning, more action)
  - Often **misattributed** to wrong causes
- Explains phenomenon like "buying tomorrow's groceries based on today's hunger"
  - Today's hunger is an internal affective signal always available (whether realized or not)
  - Has impact on kinds of decisions made

#### Memory Systems Foundation
- **Long-term memory systems:**
  - **Implicit memory:** Procedural knowledge (things you know how to do)
  - **Explicit/declarative memory:** Facts and knowledge (focus of this lecture)
- **Two types of explicit memory:**
  - **Episodic memory:** Raw experiences; vivid, first-person; preserve emotional content, context, sensory details (like mental replay)
  - **Semantic memory:** Abstracted knowledge; decontextualized, timeless facts (e.g., "my friend is funny"—not tied to here/now/later)
- Semantic knowledge built up as **compression of past experiences**
  - Parallel to early course content: infants learning causal rules from physical observations, bootstrapping conceptual understanding

#### Schematization Process
- **Schema:** Organized knowledge structures formed by abstracting common patterns across events over time
- **Schematization:** Compression/abstraction process converting episodic experiences into semantic knowledge
- Visual metaphor: Different events/episodes over a day → constantly evaluating, compressing, abstracting → crystallizing what's common across events in time → holds true regardless of here and now
- Schemas exist for many domains: sequences of events, situations, actions, people, and **ourselves**

#### How Schemas Guide Perception and Behavior
- External signal (perception) → triggers internal signals (mood, feelings) → activates relevant **crystallized semantic knowledge** → drives behavior (decisions, actions, preferences)
- Schemas function as **simplified internal models shaped by past experiences**
- Purpose: Predict what happens next and guide actions/behaviors (connects to predictive processing themes from earlier in course)

#### View 1: Self as Schema
- **Self = schematized autobiographical memories**
- Compress personal experiences and knowledge generalized about yourself over time
- Dynamic interplay between:
  - Episodic memories (raw experiences)
  - Semantic memories (autobiographical facts)
  - Emotional importance of events
  - Sensation and feeling of events
  - Temporal structure (how events unfolded)
- Process: How experiences crystallize into self-knowledge through schematization becomes "you"
- **Key insight:** Self is the natural consequence when schematization is applied to autobiographical memories

#### View 2: Self as Social Construction
- **Looking glass self** (Cooley, 1929): You are who you believe others see you to be
- Identity as amalgamation of how parents, significant others, siblings perceive you
- **Neuroscience evidence** (Canvas assignment video):
  - Put participant in fMRI scanner, have them think about self-descriptive words
  - Put friends in scanner, have them think about same words as they apply to the target person
  - **Finding:** Strong correlation in **ventromedial prefrontal cortex** (vmPFC, above eyeballs) between person's self-representation and friends' representations of that person
  - When friends think about you, their brain activity patterns **recapitulate** the structure observed when you think about yourself
- **Implication:** Activity patterns representing "you" don't just live in your brain—they also live in brains of people who know you
- Self-perception is not independent of social world; overlap between how your brain constructs you and how friends' brains construct you

#### View 3: Self as Causal Narrative
- Recent computational perspective inspired by **power of stories and narratives**
- **Key property of narratives:** Defined by **causal connections between events over time**
- Stories make complex information easier to understand (e.g., tracking character motivations, relationships, events in a movie)
- **Central question:** If we track others' behavior over time through narratives, does the brain do the same for the self?

#### Narrative Self Research (UC Riverside)
- Experimental design:
  - Participants rate how much traits describe themselves
  - Receive social feedback (e.g., from "evaluation committee")
  - Rate themselves again
- **Network analysis of trait relationships:**
  - Map which traits are **causally connected** to others (which seem to cause or influence other traits)
  - **Highly connected traits** (e.g., friendly, cooperative) are more central—big influence on other self-beliefs
- **Key finding:** Traits with high causal centrality (those that influence/cause many others) are **most susceptible to updating** when receiving feedback from others
  - Metaphor: Like scene 3 being pivotal to a screenplay—feedback about scene 3 demands attention and updating; feedback about unimportant scenes can be ignored
- **Computational insight:** Self-schema is not fixed set of traits/memories in isolation
  - You **traverse the web** of self-knowledge, hopping between connections in a sequence
  - Sequence follows **cause-and-effect relationships**
  - Sequence is **shaped by social world** (feedback changes causal structure)
- **Changing beliefs about yourself:** In this framework, belief change = rearranging causal connections (like re-editing movie scenes)

#### Three Views Synthesized
- **Self as internal schema:** Same schematization process applied to episodic/semantic memories about self (compression of autobiographical experience)
- **Self as social construction:** Signals from other people influence how we construct sense of self (we care how others think about us; neural representations overlap)
- **Self as causal narrative:** Adding dimension of time—self is not just collection of facts or purely dictated by others, but a **story woven from traits/memories** that you rehearse to yourself and others; sequences can be rearranged like scenes in a film

### Highlights
- **Affect operates as a heuristic:** Internal signals like mood and hunger influence judgments and decisions, often outside awareness, and can be misattributed to wrong causes
- **The self emerges from memory compression:** One foundational view conceptualizes self as the natural output of schematization applied to autobiographical memories—transforming raw experiences into organized semantic knowledge
- **Your self lives in others' brains:** Neuroscience reveals that how you think about yourself (vmPFC activity patterns) is mirrored in the brains of your close friends when they think about you, supporting the "looking glass self" perspective
- **Self-beliefs have causal structure:** Like narratives, self-knowledge consists of causally connected traits and memories; centrally connected beliefs are most susceptible to social feedback and updating
- **Course synthesis:** Part 1 (Lewin's equation: behavior = person × environment), Part 2 (Simon's scissors: cognition adapted to context), Part 3 (social signals—internal/external information influencing perception of faces, people, and self)

### Weeks 9-10 Summary

- **Affective synchrony builds connection:** Synchronized facial expressions and physiological states during shared experiences predict growing social bonds, even in passive contexts like watching TV together.
- **Social signals transmit beliefs:** Facial expressions can convey expectations powerfully enough to alter another person's subjective experience and autonomic responses (socially transmitted placebo effect).
- **Context dominates expression interpretation:** In natural settings, contextual information (body, situation, events) has larger effects on emotion interpretation than facial signals alone—faces are one cue among many.
- **Emotion theories span a spectrum:** From Basic Emotion (discrete, universal) to Constructed Emotion (moment-by-moment assembly), with the course perspective occupying a center position acknowledging both consistency and variability.
- **The self is multiply constructed:** Understanding the self requires integrating schematization (memory compression), social construction (looking glass self), and causal narrative (story-like structure)—all shaped by the same cognitive processes studied throughout the course.
