### Core Question / Problem

Do "uncanny" reactions to highly humanlike artifacts reflect a real, measurable nonlinear relation between human likeness and likability (Mori’s "uncanny valley") — and if so, what cognitive mechanisms produce it? The paper reviews empirical evidence, evaluates competing explanations, and proposes a new account called the Dehumanization hypothesis.

### Conceptual or Computational Framework

The authors situate the problem at the intersection of perceptual sensitivity (animacy detection), social‑cognitive attribution (mind perception / mentalizing), and evolutionary‑inspired affective responses (disgust, fear). They frame the uncanny as a cognitive–perceptual problem that can be tested statistically (linear vs. nonlinear relation between human likeness and likability) and mechanistically (two‑stage animacy → scrutiny → dehumanization process).

### Methods Overview

This is a conceptual, integrative review. The authors inspect empirical studies that used (a) morphed image continua, (b) ratings of real androids/avatars, (c) psychophysiological and neural measures (ERPs, fMRI), and (d) infant and nonhuman primate work. They critique measurement confounds in both independent (human likeness) and dependent ("shinwakan" → likability/affinity/eeriness) variables and propose a residual‑analysis test of Mori’s curve as an empirical fix.

### Key Findings

- Evidence for an uncanny valley is mixed: some morph‑based studies and Mathur & Reichling (2016) show nonlinear dips in likability, while many studies of existing replicas do not. 
- Methodological heterogeneity (how "likability/uncanniness" and "human likeness" are operationalized) likely explains divergent findings. The paper catalogs inconsistent translations of Mori’s shinwakan and recommends multi‑indicator measures.&#x20;
- Multiple mechanisms have been proposed (pathogen avoidance → disgust; mortality salience → terror management; evolutionary aesthetics; violation of expectation; categorical uncertainty; mind perception), but none singly account for the full pattern. The authors critique limited causal tests and ecological validity in many studies.&#x20;
- They propose the Dehumanization hypothesis: realistic anthropomorphism creates an initial impression of humanness (quick animacy detection), which invites deeper scrutiny; detection of mechanistic or non‑human features then triggers dehumanization (perceiving the agent as lacking human nature or uniqueness), producing negative affect and the uncanny response.&#x20;

### Interpretation & Significance

Wang et al. recast the uncanny problem from an engineering curve‑hunt into a psychological process question: what perceptual and social‑cognitive computations produce negative affect toward near‑human agents? This reframing emphasizes mechanisms (animacy detection, mind perception, dehumanization) that map directly onto course concepts such as Animacy, Mentalizing, and Representation. The paper also proposes concrete statistical and experimental tests that move the field toward principled, falsifiable models.

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat

From a Marr‑inspired perspective: at the computational level the problem is to predict when an agent will elicit positive social affiliation vs. aversive uncanniness. Algorithmically, the paper suggests a two‑stage pipeline: (1) fast form/animacy detection that triggers the Intentional Stance and anthropomorphism; (2) slower validation/scrutiny that compares predicted properties (agency, experience) with observed cues — large prediction errors (mismatch) drive dehumanization and negative valence. Implementationally, the authors point to ERP (N170 / late positive potentials) and fusiform/pSTS signatures consistent with these stages.

### Teaching Hooks

- Show students a short sequence of morphed faces (toy → doll → human) and collect instant likability/animacy judgments; use results to motivate categorical uncertainty vs. violation‑of‑expectation debates.
- Contrast reactions to a photorealistic CGI baby (e.g., an old demo) vs. a stylized robot to prompt discussion of anthropomorphism and dehumanization.

### Pedagogical Lens

Translate the paper’s claims into predictive modeling exercises: have students build simple regressions of likability on human‑likeness and inspect residual patterns (is there a dip?). Then extend to a two‑process model where presentation time modulates whether animacy or dehumanization dominates.

### Connections

Links to course glossary concepts: Animacy and Mentalizing (perceptual triggers), Intentional Stance (why we adopt humanlike explanations), Representation & Predictive Mind (prediction/validation pipeline), and Synchrony (contrast: synchrony increases affiliation; uncanny responses reduce it).&#x20;

### Key Quotes or Phrases

- "The uncanny valley hypothesis is ultimately an engineering problem..." (paper’s framing).
- "We propose a Dehumanization hypothesis." (central proposal).&#x20;

### Concept Graph

- Rapid animacy/form detection → anthropomorphism (fast, perceptual).
- Anthropomorphism → deeper scrutiny (slow, cognitive).
  - **Dehumanization hypothesis:** When scrutiny reveals mechanistic/nonhuman cues, observers deny human nature/uniqueness, producing negative affect and 'uncanniness.' **Notable Figures:** Wang, Lilienfeld, Rochat (2015). **Related Concepts:** Animacy, Mind Perception, Infrahumanization.
  - **Violated Expectation:** Mismatch between appearance and motion/voice. **Related Concepts:** Predictive Mind; Prediction Error.

### Relevant Terms

- **Existing Terms Used:** Animacy; Intentional Stance; Mentalizing; Agency; Representation; Predictive Mind.
- **New Terms to Add:**
  - **Uncanny valley:** Nonlinear relation (hypothesized) between human likeness and social affinity; a dip of negative affect for near‑human but imperfect replicas. **Notable Figures:** Masahiro Mori. **Related Concepts:** Animacy; Anthropomorphism; Dehumanization.
  - **Dehumanization hypothesis:** A process model proposing that anthropomorphism (initial attribution of humanness) followed by detection of mechanistic discrepancies leads observers to dehumanize replicas (deny human nature/uniqueness), producing uncanny affect. **Notable Figures:** Wang, Lilienfeld, Rochat (2015). **Related Concepts:** Infrahumanization; Mind Perception; Violation of Expectation.
