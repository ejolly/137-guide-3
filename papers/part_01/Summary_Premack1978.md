# Core Question / Problem
Can non-human primates (chimpanzees) attribute mental states (beliefs, desires, intentions) to others — i.e., do they possess a theory of mind?

# Conceptual or Computational Framework
Premack & Woodruff frame ToM as an ability to infer hidden mental states from observed behaviour and situational context. Experimentally, they probe whether chimps can predict another agent’s behavior based on the agent’s (possibly false) beliefs — a classic computational question about representing other minds.

# Methods Overview
Longitudinal/descriptive experimental paradigms: observational reports and structured tasks where chimpanzees interact with informed or uninformed trainers separated by mesh partitions; senders and receivers manipulate signals to test whether chimpanzees understand others’ knowledge states. fileciteturn1file8L9-L17

# Key Findings
- Evidence suggested some chimpanzees could flexibly use information about another’s knowledge or intention (e.g., pointing strategies to inform a benevolent trainer or to deceive a selfish one).
- Results were suggestive but not definitive; Premack & Woodruff urged more controlled tests (e.g., false-belief style tasks) to settle whether chimp performance reflects mindreading or sophisticated behavioral reading. fileciteturn1file8L35-L49

# Interpretation & Significance
Premack & Woodruff’s paper launched ToM as an empirical question and a research program. It reframed comparative cognition: rather than assuming human uniqueness, it asked what computational representations (if any) animals use to predict others. The paper set the stage for decades of follow-ups that refined tasks (false-belief tasks, looking-time measures) and clarified species differences.

# Computational–Social–Cognitive–Scientist Hat
- Lewin: behavior depends on person and environment; Premack’s tasks manipulated informational environments to reveal internal representations.
- Marr: computational goal = predict other’s behavior; algorithmic question = what representations/operations support this? Implementational = neural substrates across species.
- Brunswik: stresses ecological validity — animal tests must respect natural communicative contexts (senders/receivers).

# Teaching Hooks
- Recreate the sender-receiver experimental logic in class: students act as trainers with/without knowledge to see how others signal.
- Contrast Premack’s paradigms with infant false-belief tasks to show methodological evolution.

# Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 2.5/5
- Pre-requisites: experimental logic, basic representational thinking
- Common misconceptions: early positive claims = definitive proof of ToM in chimps — clarify nuance and need for replication and stricter controls
- Discussion prompt: Design a modern controlled test (nonverbal) that would distinguish behavioral-reading from belief-attribution in chimpanzees.

# Connections
- Directly ties to the course glossary’s ToM entry (Premack & Woodruff 1978) and subsequent human infant literature. fileciteturn1file4L22-L26

# Key Quotes or Phrases
- “The test is quite simple.” (description of sender/receiver setup) — a good lecture vignette. fileciteturn1file8L9-L16

# Concept Graph
- Observed behavior + context → inferred knowledge state → predictive behavior (sender/receiver strategy)
- Controlled manipulations → distinguish mentalizing vs behavior-reading

# Relevant Terms
- **Existing Terms Used:** Theory of Mind; Mentalizing; False-Belief Task. fileciteturn1file4L22-L26
- **New Terms to Add:** *Sender–Receiver informational test (definition):* a task structure where one agent has privileged information and another must infer or act based on signals — useful for probing mindreading vs behavioral cue use.
