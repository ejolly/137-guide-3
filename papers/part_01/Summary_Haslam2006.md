### Core Question / Problem
How can we conceptually and empirically unify the many uses of "dehumanization" across domains (race/ethnicity, gender/pornography, disability, medicine, technology), and what are its psychological bases? Haslam argues that prior work lacked a clear analysis of what is being denied — "humanness" — and that clarifying that concept reveals two distinct forms of dehumanization.

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
Haslam distinguishes two senses of humanness: **Uniquely Human (UH)** properties (those that distinguish humans from animals — higher cognition, civility, moral refinement) and **Human Nature (HN)** properties (core, embodied, affective features such as warmth, emotionality, agency, depth). Denying UH → **animalistic dehumanization**; denying HN → **mechanistic dehumanization**. These map onto different semiotics, emotions, and social contexts, and can be formalized as two orthogonal latent dimensions of perceived humanness.

### Methods Overview
This is a theoretical integrative review that synthesizes historical, qualitative, and quantitative studies. Haslam draws on empirical work (including Haslam et al., 2004/2005 trait‑rating and GNAT studies), infra‑humanization findings (Leyens et al.), and cognitive‑neuroscientific/clinical observations (e.g., frontotemporal dementia, autism, psychopathy) to support the UH/HN distinction. Figures and a summary table illustrate the mapping between trait clusters and dehumanization forms (see Figure 1, p.6; Table 1, p.9).

### Key Findings
- Empirical trait ratings show UH and HN load on distinct sets of characteristics and are weakly or negatively correlated, supporting two separable senses of humanness.
- *Animalistic dehumanization* (denial of UH) is linked to intergroup contexts (racism, genocide), evokes disgust/contempt, uses vertical metaphors (less than human), and depends on essentialized group boundaries.
- *Mechanistic dehumanization* (denial of HN) portrays people as cold, inert, objectlike or machine‑like (e.g., in medicine, technology, objectification of women), evokes indifference, and often correlates with psychological distance and low empathy.
- Social‑cognitive mechanisms proposed include relational construals (Fiske’s relational models), cognitive modality transfer (folk‑biology or technical thinking), explanatory asymmetries (Malle’s reasons vs causal histories), social categorization, psychological distance, and empathy deficits.

### Interpretation & Significance
Haslam’s model broadens dehumanization beyond spectacular violence to everyday perceptions (stereotypes, objectification, depersonalization). Conceptually, it turns a monolithic construct into two measurable dimensions (UH, HN), each with distinct predictors, affective signatures, and moral consequences. This reframing clarifies why similar phrasing ("not fully human") appears across diverse domains yet produces different social outcomes.

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
Formalize perceived humanness as a 2D latent vector h = [UH, HN]. Downstream functions map h → {empathy, disgust, moral_exclusion, helping_intent}. Hypotheses:
- Increasing psychological distance reduces HN more than UH (ΔHN < 0), thereby lowering predicted empathy via a monotonic function E = f(HN).
- Essentialist group beliefs amplify animalistic dehumanization by shifting UH perceptions downward for outgroups (UH_outgroup = UH_baseline − ε_essentialism).
- Mechanistic dehumanization arises when construals are abstract (high-level) and when explanatory styles emphasize causal histories over belief‑based reasons; operationalize via coding of explanations.
Suggested operational tests: GNAT for implicit associations, trait‑rating batteries for UH/HN, manipulation of construal level (Trope & Liberman), and behavioral measures (willingness to punish/help; physiological empathy markers).

### Teaching Hooks
- Abu Ghraib images illustrate animalistic humiliation and disgust (discussion: why bodily exposure matters?).
- Objectification in pornography and medicine (mechanistic routes): explore Nussbaum (1999) and patient dehumanization in clinical settings.
- Infra‑humanization studies (Leyens et al.) as empirical bridge between UH denial and intergroup outcomes.

### Pedagogical Lens
For undergraduates, present the UH/HN distinction with simple vignettes: a homeless person being called "animal" (animalistic) vs. a patient spoken about as a case file (mechanistic). Use short GNAT demos or coding exercises where students rate traits and map them onto UH/HN.

### Connections
Links to course concepts: mentalizing/intentional stance (animacy cues trigger intentional stance; lack of HN undermines empathy and mentalizing), essentialism, psychological distance, predictive mind (reduced model complexity for distant/abstract others), objectification and moral exclusion.

### Key Quotes or Phrases
- "Two forms of dehumanization: the denial of uniquely human attributes and the denial of human nature." (p.252)
- "Animalistic dehumanization evokes disgust; mechanistic dehumanization evokes indifference." (pp.7–8)

### Concept Graph
- Humanness → two senses: UH (Uniquely Human) and HN (Human Nature).
  - **Uniquely Human (UH):** Traits that distinguish humans from animals (language, refinement, moral sensibility). **Notable Figures:** Haslam; Leyens. **Related Concepts:** Infra‑humanization, socialization.
  - **Human Nature (HN):** Core affective/agentive traits (warmth, emotionality, agency, depth). **Notable Figures:** Haslam. **Related Concepts:** Empathy, psychological distance, essentialism.
- **Animalistic Dehumanization:** Denial of UH → likening to animals; associated with disgust/contempt; prototypically intergroup. **Related Concepts:** Infra‑humanization, moral exclusion.
- **Mechanistic Dehumanization:** Denial of HN → likening to objects/machines; associated with indifference; occurs interpersonally and in institutional contexts. **Related Concepts:** Objectification, depersonalization.
