# Core Question / Problem
What historical schools of thought shaped the emergence of social cognition (behaviorism → Gestalt/cognitivism → computational cognitive science), and how do these lineages inform contemporary approaches?

# Conceptual or Computational Framework
Historical synthesis: maps intellectual lineage from empiricism & behaviorism through gestalt (Asch, Heider, Bartlett) to Marr’s levels and the predictive mind. Emphasizes how representational commitments (schemas, theories) reintroduced internal structure to explain social behavior.

# Methods Overview
Historical narrative drawing on primary papers and classical experiments (Asch impression formation, Bartlett memory work, Heider’s attributions).

# Key Findings / Claims
- Behaviorism sidelined mental explanations; Gestalt and cognitive pioneers reintroduced mental structure and meaning.
- Lewin’s field theory (B = f(P, E)) anticipated modern representation‑inclusive models (add R).
- The computational turn formalized representation and algorithmic levels (Marr), enabling modern generative/predictive frameworks.

# Interpretation & Significance
Provides students context: why contemporary social cognition focuses on representations, algorithms, and prediction. It explains conceptual shifts and why certain methods (reaction times, narration, neuroimaging) rose to prominence.

# Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- Lewin: situates behavior as emergent from person and environment; modern accounts add explicit representation R.
- Marr: historical narrative culminates in Marr’s levels as a synthesis tool.
- Brunswik: historical emphasis on cue validity and ecological sampling is a throughline.

# Teaching Hooks
- Timeline slide: map major milestones (Behaviorism → Gestalt/Cognitivism → Computational Cognitive Science → Predictive Mind).
- Classroom debate: Was the cognitive revolution a reinstatement of “folk psychology” or a methodological advance?

# Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 2/5
- Pre‑requisites: none beyond curiosity
- Misconceptions: that older theories are “wrong” rather than limited in scope.
- Discussion prompt: How did methodological limits of the behaviorist era shape the questions asked in social psychology?

# Connections
- Ties to all course modules: attributions, schemas, mentalizing, predictive models.

# Key Quotes or Phrases
- “Understanding the history clarifies why we now ask what representations do, not whether they exist.”  
- “Lewin’s field theory foreshadows the modern inclusion of Representations in behavior functions.”

# Concept Graph
- Historical movements → theories of mind (schemas, attribution, computation) → modern predictive frameworks

# Relevant Terms
**Existing Terms Used:**
- Behaviorism
- Cognitivism
- Field Theory
- Lewin’s equation (B = f(P, E))
- Marr’s Levels

**New Terms to Add:**
- Grand‑truism: shorthand for Lewin’s claim that behavior is a function of person and environment; propose formalizing as B = f(P, E, R) in course glossary.
