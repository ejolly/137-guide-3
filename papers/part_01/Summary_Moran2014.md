### Core Question / Problem
Why do people tend to favor dispositional explanations (the fundamental attribution error, FAE) even when situational factors are obvious? The paper asks whether spontaneous activation of mentalizing processes and associated neural systems (default mode network) predicts dispositional attributions.

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
The paper frames FAE as a default inference strategy arising from spontaneous activation of mentalizing machinery (intentional stance). They connect dispositional inference to activity in core mentalizing regions (medial PFC, TPJ) and situational inference to limbic/temporal regions (e.g., amygdala, temporal pole).

### Methods Overview
Multi-experiment approach combining fMRI with behavioral attribution tasks. Key paradigm: participants read ambiguous scenarios and later provide dispositional vs. situational explanations while brain activity (and resting-state network architecture) is measured. Contrasts isolate brain regions predicting dispositional vs. situational attributions.

### Key Findings
- Spontaneous recruitment of core mentalizing regions (dmPFC, TPJ) during initial reading predicted later dispositional attributions.  
- These regions are part of the default mode network, whose high baseline activity may bias perceivers toward dispositional inference.  
- Individuals with reduced default network activity (e.g., autism) may show reduced FAE — supporting a mechanistic link between spontaneous mentalizing and attribution bias.  

### Interpretation & Significance
The study reframes FAE not as merely a cognitive shortcut or effort‑saving heuristic but as a consequence of an adaptive, automatically engaged system for understanding others. The default network’s tonic activity may create a processing bias: adopting the intentional stance is the brain’s baseline approach to social input.

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
Model implication: a prioritized prior favoring dispositional causes—implemented via default network baseline—requires cognitive effort to override (situational re‑weighting). Models of social inference should include tonic activation of mind‑attribution priors and a control process to integrate situational evidence.

### Teaching Hooks
- Show students fMRI images contrasting dispositional vs. situational attributions and ask them to predict which brain regions light up.  
- Classroom exercise: present ambiguous scenarios; have half the class list situational factors first, the other half list traits first — compare explanations.

### Pedagogical Lens
Tie to Lewin’s equation by discussing how P (person), E (environment), and R (representations) interact: spontaneous mentalizing reflects R bias toward internal explanations. Connect to predictive processing: the brain’s prior leads to dispositional predictions.

### Connections
Bridges attribution theory, Default Mode Network research, and developmental work on autism. Directly links to the Brüne review’s neural localization and Thornton’s work on person representations via mental states.

### Key Quotes or Phrases

*Pedagogical note:* This paper is excellent for linking neural mechanisms to classic social-psychological phenomena and for teaching how spontaneous neural processes produce robust cognitive biases.
