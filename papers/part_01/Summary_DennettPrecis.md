### Full Citation
Dennett, D. C. (Précis). A Précis of *The Intentional Stance*. fileciteturn1file7

### Topic Tags
intentional stance; Searle critique; heuristic overlay; consensus in philosophy of mind.

### Core Question / Problem
Why is the intentional stance defensible as a pragmatic, heuristic strategy given critiques (e.g., Searle's Chinese Room) that demand metaphysical grounding?

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
Dennett argues the stance is a "heuristic overlay" that captures a community of practices; disagreements often reflect overstatements rather than deep problems. The defense emphasizes explanatory power and empirical adequacy over metaphysical commitments. fileciteturn1file7

### Methods Overview
Essay‑length précis with commentary on contemporary debates (Sellars, Quine, Searle, Fodor) and notes on the consensus shifting toward a moderate, pragmatic view.

### Key Findings
- Responds to Searle: even if biochemistry produces intentionality, that doesn't resolve the epistemic/practical reasons we adopt the stance. fileciteturn1file7  
- Philosophers are converging on seeing intentional attribution as a useful heuristic rather than a metaphysical claim. fileciteturn1file7

### Interpretation & Significance
The Précis helps students situate Dennett historically and shows why the Intentional Stance remains influential: it provides an operational toolkit for prediction and explanation across domains (AI, economics, psychology). fileciteturn1file7

### Teaching Hooks
- Pair the précis with the 1971 article and Searle’s Chinese Room thought experiment for an in‑class debate.

### Relevant Terms
