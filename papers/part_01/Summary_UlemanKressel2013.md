### Core Question / Problem
How do perceivers form stable impressions from limited behavioral data, what representational structures support impressions (e.g., trait inference, schema), and how have theories evolved historically?

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
Uleman & Kressel trace impression formation from trait averaging and associative network models to modern constructive frameworks emphasizing schemata and predictive representations. Map: Computational (goal = accurate social inference and memory efficiency), Algorithmic (representations: trait nodes, schemas, associative weights), Implementational (memory systems, attention).

### Methods Overview
This review synthesizes decades of laboratory paradigms: trait inference tasks, spontaneous trait transference, person memory paradigms, and comparative judgments across individuals and groups. Key manipulations include exposure content (behavior descriptions), trait diagnosticity, and context (semantic priming, group stereotypes).

### Key Findings
- Impression formation exhibits regularities: two fundamental evaluative dimensions (warmth/competence) robustly structure judgments across targets and contexts. fileciteturn1file11
- Schemas and associative networks explain many ordering and memory effects: perceivers use prior knowledge to fill gaps and generate stable trait impressions even from sparse data. fileciteturn1file11
- Perceiver goals, attention, and social visibility modulate accuracy vs bias: reputations are more accurate for well‑known targets; for unfamiliar targets, prior theories drive impressions. fileciteturn1file2

### Interpretation & Significance
The paper situates impression formation as both adaptive (fast, memory‑efficient) and error‑prone (biases from priors and schemas). For computational social cognition, it highlights the need to model how priors, evidence sampling, and representational compression trade off accuracy for efficiency — a classic rational analysis problem.

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- Lewin: Impression = R in B = f(P,E,R) — internal "life‑space" encoding of others.
- Marr: Algorithmic focus on how trait‑based or schema representations map behaviors to predictions.
- Brunswik: Stresses ecological validity — cue reliability matters for accurate impressions.

### Teaching Hooks
- Short "vignette swap" in class: give students minimal behaviors and see how trait attributions converge.
- Warmth/Competence quadrant exercise with celebrities or brands.

### Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 3
- Pre‑requisites: basic memory and schema theory, attribution basics
- Misconceptions: Averaging vs weighted diagnostic inference — perceivers often privilege diagnostic behaviors.
- Exam prompt: "Describe two models of impression formation (trait averaging vs schema‑based) and design an experiment to distinguish them."

### Connections
Links to mind perception (pre‑attributional stages), stereotyping research, and predictive processing via priors/schemas.

### Concept Graph
- Observed behaviors → trait inference (diagnostic weighting) → memory/schema updating → predicted future behavior.

### Relevant Terms
**Existing Terms Used:**
- Schema; Representation; Attribution Theory; Warmth/Competence (as impression dimensions). fileciteturn1file11

**New Terms to Add:**
- **Diagnostic Weighting:** The process by which perceivers weight behaviors by their informativeness for particular trait inferences.
- **Spontaneous Trait Transference:** The phenomenon where traits linked to described behaviors become associated with the actor in memory.
