### Core Question / Problem
Why do young children fail classic false‑belief tasks (around age 3) but pass related tasks that seem closely analogous? Is there a conceptual change (stage‑like revolution) in the child’s folk‑psychology, or can performance be explained by the computational heuristics children use?

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
Fodor proposes a **heuristic**/resource‑based account rather than radical conceptual discontinuity. He frames two heuristics (H1, H2): H1 predicts actions from desires alone (simpler); H2 predicts from desires+beliefs (computationally costlier). Children prefer H1 when it yields a unique prediction and resort to H2 only when H1 is underdetermined. This accounts for why 3‑year‑olds fail classic false‑belief tasks but succeed on some related paradigms.

### Methods Overview
Fodor reviews classic paradigms (Sally‑Anne false belief, deception, appearance‑reality, Polaroid/photograph tasks) and draws on variants and controls that tease apart whether children lack the concept of belief or merely prefer cheaper heuristics. He proposes experimental variants that would adjudicate his account (e.g., multi‑container division, object disappearance, not‑own belief with feedback manipulations).

### Key Findings / Arguments
- Empirical dissociations (children passing deception or appearance‑reality tasks yet failing false‑belief tasks) challenge strong claims that children lack any representation of belief.
- A heuristic ordering account parsimoniously predicts observed behavior without invoking radical conceptual change: children compute using H1 by default and invoke H2 selectively.
- Fodor generalizes the idea via markedness: adult representations normally have an “unmarked” (true) value; children exploit this and only deploy belief‑sensitive strategies when required by task constraints.
- The account yields precise, testable predictions and a set of experimental manipulations that should differentially affect 3‑ vs 4‑year‑olds.

### Interpretation & Significance
Fodor’s paper reframes developmental ToM failure as a tradeoff between computational cost and predictive reliability rather than an all‑or‑none conceptual leap. This supports views that emphasize continuity (incremental tuning of heuristics and resources) and aligns with algorithmic‑level explanations (how children represent and compute), more than metaphysical claims about conceptual possession.

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
Fodor’s heuristics map naturally onto bounded‑rationality models and resource‑rational accounts: limited working memory / representational bandwidth favors reliance on simpler decision rules (H1) unless ambiguity forces recruitment of richer models (H2). This suggests computational models that implement priority ordering over inference rules with a cost function for representational complexity.

### Teaching Hooks
- Run the classic Sally‑Anne demo and then a multi‑container variant to show how task framing changes predicted performance under H1/H2.
- Classroom debate: Is development driven more by representational capacity or by heuristic strategy selection?

### Pedagogical Lens
Use Fodor to introduce students to the difference between conceptual‑change theories and resource/heuristic accounts. Emphasize falsifiability via the experimental variants Fodor proposes.

### Connections
Links developmental ToM to bounded rationality, predictive mind ideas (selective deployment of complex generative models), and the broader debate (simulation vs. theory‑theory).

### Key Quotes or Phrases
- “All that happens is that the trade‑off between predictive reliability and computational complexity increasingly favors the former as computation space gets cheaper.”

### Concept Graph
- Heuristic ordering → developmental performance differences
  - **H1 (Desire heuristic):** predict action from desires alone when unique. **Related Concepts:** Simple desire psychology, bounded rationality.
  - **H2 (Belief+Desire heuristic):** incorporate beliefs when H1 is underdetermined. **Related Concepts:** False belief, metarepresentation.
