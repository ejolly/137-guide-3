# Core Question / Problem
Are there algorithms or brain implementations that are specialized for social cognition, or does social behavior reuse general-purpose mechanisms? How should we test social specificity across Marr’s levels?

# Conceptual or Computational Framework
The paper argues for careful separation of Marr’s levels when evaluating social specificity. It reviews candidate social algorithms (e.g., ToM-like belief inference, social valuation learning) and potential implementational specializations (e.g., ACCg). It advocates computational modeling + multivariate neural methods to bridge algorithm and implementation. fileciteturn1file2L3-L11

# Methods Overview
A review and synthesis of computational modelling studies, neuroimaging findings, comparative evidence (non-human animals), and proposals for experimental designs that hold one level constant while probing another (e.g., vary task demands while keeping algorithmic structure fixed).

# Key Findings
- Some brain regions show social selectivity (ACCg strongest candidate), but social-specificity is clearer at implementation than at algorithmic level; algorithms like ToM show promise as socially specific. fileciteturn1file2L37-L43
- Outstanding empirical questions: species differences, innate vs learned social algorithms, and whether social vs non-social distinctions are categorical or continuous. fileciteturn1file2L24-L33

# Interpretation & Significance
The article reframes the “social brain” debate: rather than asking “is there a social brain?” it asks *where* (which Marr level) social specialization is plausible and how to design studies to answer that. For social cognition teaching, it emphasizes rigorous experimental logic: keep levels constant, use computational models to define candidate algorithms, and map predictions to neural data.

# Computational–Social–Cognitive–Scientist Hat
- Lewin: evolutionary/ontogenetic forces could bias implementations; Lockwood et al. encourage testing whether such biases are algorithmic or implementational.
- Marr: paper is explicitly Marr-oriented — advocates holding computational/algorithmic/implementational levels distinct in experiments. fileciteturn1file2L33-L36
- Brunswik: comparative and ecological validity concerns — test across species and ecological contexts.

# Teaching Hooks
- Design a student lab: two tasks with identical algorithmic structure—one social, one non-social—and predict neural dissociations.
- Discuss ACCg as a case study (what patterns would confirm social specialization?).

# Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 3.5/5
- Pre-requisites: Marr’s levels, basics of neuroimaging and computational models
- Common misconceptions: equating neural activation with algorithmic specificity
- Discussion prompt: Propose an experiment that isolates algorithmic social specificity.

# Connections
- Connects to theory-of-mind debates (Premack & Woodruff) and predictive frameworks (how predictive models might implement social algorithms).

# Concept Graph
- Algorithm (ToM) → neural implementation candidate (ACCg) → behavioral social predictions
- Comparative tests → evaluate innateness vs learning
- Continuous vs categorical social/non-social distinction → shapes experimental expectations
