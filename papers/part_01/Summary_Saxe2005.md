### Core Question / Problem
What is the specific contribution of the right temporo‑parietal junction (RTPJ) to Theory of Mind? Saxe & Wexler review evidence that RTPJ plays a selective role in belief attribution (representing others’ informational states) rather than more general social or attentional processes.

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
The authors argue for functional specialization: RTPJ implements computations required to represent others' beliefs (meta‑representations) — a clear mapping from cognitive function (belief‑attribution) to neural substrate.

### Methods Overview
Evidence comes from fMRI studies using false‑belief tasks, lesion case studies, and controlled contrasts separating belief reasoning from attentional/agency confounds.

### Key Findings
- RTPJ activation is reliably elicited by tasks requiring attribution of beliefs, especially when those beliefs diverge from reality.
- Adjacent regions implicated in attention, language, or perceptual processing do not share RTPJ’s selective profile.
- Lesion and TMS studies suggest causal necessity: disrupting RTPJ impairs belief attribution.

### Interpretation & Significance
Saxe & Wexler sharpen the functional taxonomy of social brain regions. Identifying RTPJ’s selective role supports computational modeling of ToM where a distinct module (or algorithmic process) computes meta‑representations of others’ informational states.

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- Computational goal: infer other's epistemic state (what they believe).
- Algorithmic view: represent nested beliefs and update them based on perceived evidence.
- Implementation: RTPJ computes belief‑relevant conditional probabilities and supports perspective‑taking.

### Teaching Hooks
- Run through Sally‑Anne task and map which neural nodes are recruited when belief ≠ reality.
- Discuss how to design an fMRI contrast that isolates belief representation (control for attention, language).

### Connections
Directly connects to Mitchell (2009) on decomposing social cognition and to developmental false‑belief literature. It provides the neural anchor for belief computations in computational models.
