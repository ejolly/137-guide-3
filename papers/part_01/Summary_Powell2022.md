### Core Question / Problem
What is the origin of a concept of social affiliation? Powell proposes that infants’ early concept of affiliation is based not on similarity or coalitional cues, but on *adopted utility*: the extent to which one agent adopts another’s goals (imitative goal adoption).

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
Integrates infant cognition with the “naive utility calculus” framework: agents are modeled as utility‑maximizers; infants infer social relationships when an agent’s actions imply the adoption of another’s utility function. This offers a generative model for affiliation inference that is formally linked to representations of goals and rational action.

### Methods Overview
Review and synthesis of infant studies (Powell & Spelke et al.): preferential looking, imitation paradigms, and third‑party inference tasks. The key empirical pattern: infants expect imitators (agents that adopt others’ goals) to affiliate and prefer imitators as social partners.

### Key Findings / Claims
- Infants infer affiliation when one actor purposely adopts another’s goals (imitator), but not when the agent is merely the target of imitation. fileciteturn2file10
- These results are inconsistent with a simple homophily/similarity account; instead, they suggest asymmetric inference tied to agency and utility adoption. fileciteturn2file4
- The proposed concept can account for diverse early social expectations (e.g., imitation preferences, preferential approach).

### Interpretation & Significance
Powell reframes early affiliation as a function of inferred goal alignment — an infant’s internal model treats imitation as evidence for value adoption. This elegantly links goal inference, theory‑like representations (naive utility calculus), and social categorization without positing an innate coalitional module.

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- Computational: detect stable affiliative relationships to guide social learning.
- Algorithmic: infer whether agent A’s utility function matches B’s (inverse planning / naive utility calculus).
- Developmental implementational predictions: early computational mechanisms for goal inference support later cultural and group reasoning.

### Teaching Hooks
- Discuss how a generative model of goals can produce affiliation inferences; contrast with similarity/homophily explanations.
- Show infant study figures (Figure 2) and ask students to predict outcomes under different models.

### Connections
Links developmental cognitive science, inverse planning models, and social learning. Relates to Marr’s algorithmic level (representations of goals) and to broader predictive accounts of social cognition.
