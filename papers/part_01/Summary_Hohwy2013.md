# Core Question / Problem
What is the best philosophical and computational framing to explain perception as prediction-error minimization (PEM), and does PEM deliver truth-tracking (content) or only covariance-based regularities?

# Conceptual or Computational Framework
Hohwy argues PEM/Hierarchical Predictive Coding offers a principled account: perception and action serve to minimize surprisal via top-down predictions and bottom-up error signals. The account presses philosophical questions about **representational content** (how covariance becomes content) and practical worries about self-fulfilling prophecies and the limits of PEM. fileciteturn2file6L1-L9

# Methods Overview
Philosophical analysis grounded in computational neuroscience—evaluates formal PEM proposals, engages with counterexamples (illusory binding, misperception), and examines implications for content, truth, and the organism’s phenotype.

# Key Findings
- PEM explains many perceptual phenomena and provides a tight computational story for learning and perception (prediction and precision control). fileciteturn2file9L1-L8
- Important **philosophical problems remain**: linking statistical covariance (what PEM naturally provides) to representational content (truth-value) — the “Hard Problem of Content.” Without this bridge, PEM explains why some percepts are statistically unusual but not necessarily why they are false. fileciteturn2file9L23-L31
- Hohwy acknowledges constraints (phenotype, expected states) that stop the system collapsing into pathological self-fulfilling strategies (e.g., hiding in dark rooms). fileciteturn2file6L5-L12

# Interpretation & Significance
Hohwy’s book sharpens predictive-processing into a philosophically rigorous theory—one that is computationally powerful but faces meta-theoretical issues about content. For social cognition, the content problem matters: attributing beliefs/desires (ToM) requires contentful representations, so PEM proponents must show how social content arises from covariance-based learning.

# Computational–Social–Cognitive–Scientist Hat
- Lewin: PEM provides mechanistic form to “life space” priors (R) that bias behavior.
- Marr: PEM gives computational goals (minimize surprisal) and algorithmic sketches (hierarchical inference), but implementational claims must still be empirically validated.
- Brunswik: highlights the role of environmental informational covariance; Hohwy questions whether covariance suffices for content. fileciteturn2file9L23-L31

# Teaching Hooks
- Discuss sheep-as-dog example: how an atypical percept can be explained statistically versus content-wise. fileciteturn2file9L1-L6
- Classroom debate: Does covariance = content? Split students to argue for/against.

# Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 4/5
- Pre-requisites: basics of Bayesian inference, predictive coding vocabulary
- Common misconception: PEM “proves” representational content — Hohwy’s work shows the gap needs addressing.
- Exam prompt: Evaluate whether PEM can account for false-belief reasoning in ToM.

# Connections
- Directly connects to Clark (2013) on action-oriented predictive processing and to empirical attempts to link precision-weighting to attention.

# Key Quotes or Phrases
- “PEM is what enables creatures like us to hone and refine our internal models or representations about the world.” fileciteturn2file6L25-L28
- “If covariance and content are logically distinct, then it is not obvious that mirrors do in fact have any contentful properties.” fileciteturn2file16L1-L5

# Concept Graph
- Prediction (generative model) → Prediction error → Model update (learning)
- Phenotype constraints → restrict self-fulfilling minimization strategies
- Covariance vs Content tension → philosophical challenge for PEM
