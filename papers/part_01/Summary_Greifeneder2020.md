social cognition; top‑down vs bottom‑up processing; context dependency; attention; adaptation; heuristics.

### Core Question / Problem
How is social cognition distinct from general cognitive processing? Greifeneder argues social cognition is specialized for context‑sensitive, adaptive processing that supports fast, effective behavior in complex social environments.

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
The chapters frame social cognition as an adaptive information‑processing system: constrained resources force tradeoffs (speed vs accuracy), encouraging use of heuristics, top‑down priors, and socially tuned representations. Map to Marr’s levels: computational (goals: adaptive social prediction and coordination), algorithmic (heuristics, schemas, attention allocation, top‑down/bottom‑up interplay), implementational (neural attention networks implicit but not specified). See course glossary on Predictive Mind and Representation for framing. fileciteturn2file16 fileciteturn2file15

### Methods Overview
These are textbook chapters — synthetic review and didactic examples (e.g., the Wason selection task framed as social contract; gorilla inattentional blindness example). Empirical touchpoints are cited throughout (Cosmides on social‑contract improvements to reasoning; classic illusions showing context dependence).

### Key Findings
- Social context dramatically reshapes the information people use (Wason selection results; context turns hard logic into solvable problems). fileciteturn2file16  
- Perception and judgment are highly context dependent and use top‑down construals to be “good enough” for social action. fileciteturn2file16  
- Attention and memory are organized around socially relevant goals: we omit irrelevant detail and amplify trait‑consistent information via schemas and motivated processing.

### Interpretation & Significance
The chapters provide an integrated argument that social cognition is not merely “cognition + social stimuli” but often uses distinct adaptive procedures (heuristics, priors) that make human social performance efficient. This supports a predictive/representational view of social perception: representations and priors scaffold rapid social inferences (links to Generative Model and Predictive Mind in the course glossary). fileciteturn2file16 fileciteturn2file15

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- Lewin: B = f(P,E), extended — add R (representations) to explain context sensitivity and goal‑directed construals. fileciteturn2file15  
- Marr: Computational goal = predict social outcomes; algorithmic = heuristics and schemas; implementational = attention systems and cortical circuits (not deeply specified in these chapters). fileciteturn2file16  
- Brunswik: Emphasize ecological validity — social cues are noisy, so cue‑utilization matches the ecological demands described.

### Teaching Hooks
- Show the gorilla video (inattentional blindness) and compare responses.  
- Give Wason tasks in social vs non‑social framing to demonstrate context effects (Box 1.1). fileciteturn2file16

### Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 2/5  
- Prereqs: basic perception, attention, and schemas.  
- Common misconceptions: "People always reason logically" — corrected by social framing effects.  
- Discussion prompt: When is a heuristic adaptive vs harmful in social settings?

### Connections
- Links to Predictive Mind, Generative Models, Representation (course glossary). fileciteturn2file15

### Key Quotes or Phrases
- "Social cognition needs to be highly adaptive and sensitive to the requirements of a situation." fileciteturn2file16

### Concept Graph
- Social context → activates priors (why?) → changes attention allocation → alters judgment/outcome.

### Relevant Terms
- **Existing Terms Used:** Predictive Mind; Representation; Generative Model; Heuristics (implicitly as strategies); Attention; Animacy (when discussing social stimuli). fileciteturn2file15
