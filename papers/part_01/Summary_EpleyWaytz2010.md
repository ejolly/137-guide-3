### Core Question / Problem
How do people perceive "minds" in others (human and non‑human), what dimensions organize those perceptions, and how do those perceptions influence social judgment and behavior?

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
Epley & Waytz frame mind perception as a graded, two‑dimensional attributional space (Experience vs Agency) that functions as an early *preattributional* step in social cognition: first, perceivers ask “Does it have a mind?” then “What state is it in?”. This sits naturally at Marr’s Algorithmic level (representations: 2‑D mind space; operations: cues→attribution) and connects to the Computational level via the goal of enabling prediction and coordination in social environments.

### Methods Overview
This is a conceptual synthesis and review integrating laboratory experiments (e.g., cue manipulations that trigger animacy), developmental studies (infant sensitivity to teleology/goal-directed motion), cross‑cultural evidence, and moral judgment paradigms (e.g., attributions of responsibility and dehumanization). Core manipulations reviewed include motion cues, agency cues, moral contexts, and social distance (ingroup/outgroup).

### Key Findings
- Mind perception is structured primarily along two separable dimensions: **Experience** (capacity to feel) and **Agency** (capacity to plan/act). These vary independently across targets (e.g., pets = high experience/low agency; gods = high agency/low experience). fileciteturn1file3
- Perceivers use perceptual and contextual cues (animacy, goal‑directed motion, social closeness) to infer mind status; these inferences serve predictive and moral functions (assigning blame/praise, granting moral worth). fileciteturn1file12
- Mind perception is modulated by social distance and culture: ingroup members are attributed richer mental capacities than distant outgroups, and interdependent cultures show greater habitual perspective taking. fileciteturn1file14
- Errors and biases occur: people over‑attribute intentionality (leading to blame) and under‑attribute experience to dehumanized groups; activation of mind perception is effortful and context‑dependent. fileciteturn1file6

### Interpretation & Significance
Epley & Waytz show that mind perception is not a binary cognitive act but a graded representational mapping that scaffolds later causal attributions and moral evaluations. Mechanistically, the two‑dimensional representation compresses complex mental states into actionable summaries for social coordination and prediction. In course framing, this work demonstrates how Lewin’s B = f(P,E,R) benefits from an explicit representation (R) for other minds and connects to the Predictive Mind: attributing mental states improves prediction and coordination.

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- Lewin: Mind perception supplies the “R” (representation) that mediates how person and environment produce behavior.
- Marr: Algorithmic level — the two‑dimensional mind map is the representation; computational level — goal is accurate social prediction & moral evaluation.
- Brunswik: Emphasizes cue validity and ecological sampling — which cues reliably indicate agency or experience across contexts.

### Teaching Hooks
- Show Heider & Simmel animation and ask students to rate Experience/Agency for shapes.
- Moral vignette: vary perceived agency (intentional vs accidental) to generate graded blame judgments.
- Cultural comparison activity: short negotiation task with manipulated interdependence prompts.

### Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 2
- Pre‑requisites: basic attribution theory; Heider & Simmel; dimensions (warmth/competence) analogy.
- Common misconceptions: mind perception = ToM; actually it’s a perceptual/preattributional step.
- Exam prompt: "Explain how Experience and Agency differ and why each matters for moral judgment. Provide experimental evidence."

### Connections
Links to animacy, intentional stance, Theory of Mind, predictive processing, and dehumanization literature. Useful precursor reading before Wang et al. (2025).
