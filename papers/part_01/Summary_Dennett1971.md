### Core Question / Problem
What does it mean to treat systems (organisms, machines) as having beliefs and desires — and how useful is that strategy for explanation and prediction?

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
Dennett defines an Intentional System as any system whose behavior can be predicted by ascribing beliefs, desires, and rationality. He contrasts three explanatory stances: Physical (laws), Design (function), and Intentional (attributing mental states). The intentional stance is a heuristically powerful, stance‑level algorithm for prediction. Map to Marr: computational level = predicting behavior; algorithmic level = adopting a stance (rule set for ascription); implementational level = physical/biological substrate (irrelevant to stance validity). fileciteturn1file8

### Methods Overview
Philosophical analysis and illustration (AI/chess, game theory, Skinner’s behaviorism counterexamples). Dennett uses thought experiments and cross‑disciplinary examples (economics, AI) to show how intentional descriptions simplify complex design problems.

### Key Findings
- Intentional characterization is useful even for non‑biological systems (chess programs) and yields genuine predictive power without needing metaphysical claims about consciousness. fileciteturn1file8  
- Treating agents as rational approximators explains why economics and game theory succeed even if psychology must explain that rationality. fileciteturn1file8  
- The concept is "uncluttered" — it avoids metaphysical commitments and focuses on predictive/organizational utility.

### Interpretation & Significance
Dennett offers a pragmatic account: intentionality as a tool, not a metaphysical property. For social cognition, this legitimizes mental‑state attribution as an adaptive predictive strategy (aligns with course’s Intentional Stance entry). It also explains cross‑disciplinary borrowings (AI, economics) where intentional terms function as useful heuristics. fileciteturn1file8

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- Lewin: Intentional ascription is a representational heuristic within the life‑space affecting behavior prediction. fileciteturn2file15  
- Marr: Intentional stance sits at an algorithmic/heuristic level for social prediction.

### Teaching Hooks
- Use chess programs and thermostats to show when intentional attributions help/hinder prediction.  
- Contrast with Searle’s Chinese Room (see the Précis commentary) to spark debate about "real" intentionality.

### Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 3/5  
- Prereqs: Familiarity with basic philosophy of mind and attribution theory.  
- Misconceptions: That ascribing beliefs requires consciousness.

### Connections
- Directly connects to Intentional Stance, Design Stance, Mentalizing, and Generative Models in the glossary. fileciteturn2file15

### Key Quotes or Phrases
- "The concept of an Intentional system is a relatively uncluttered and unmetaphysical notion." fileciteturn1file8

### Concept Graph
- System complexity → choice of stance (physical/design/intentional) → prediction accuracy.
