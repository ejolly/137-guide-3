# Core Question / Problem
How did brains evolve to solve novel social challenges using pre‑existing neural mechanisms? Parkinson & Wheatley synthesize evidence for 'repurposing' (neural reuse) showing how circuits for perception, space and sensory processing are co‑opted for social functions.

# Conceptual or Computational Framework
The paper emphasizes a constraints‑and‑reuse view: evolutionary, cultural and instrumental repurposing reuse existing representational circuits to implement social computations. At Marr’s computational level the goal is flexible social prediction; algorithmically the brain reconfigures spatial/temporal representations (e.g., distance maps) to encode social distances or abstract social variables. Implementationally, neural circuits initially supporting perception/space are co-opted in social tasks.

# Methods Overview
This is a review that integrates comparative data, neuroimaging meta‑analyses, lesion studies, and theoretical work on neural reuse (e.g., Anderson’s reuse, Dehaene’s cultural recycling).

# Key Findings
- Converging evidence that areas normally associated with perception and spatial coding are active in social tasks (e.g., mapping social distance onto cortical metrics). fileciteturn1file4
- Three kinds of repurposing identified: evolutionary, cultural, and instrumental — each operating on different timescales and mechanisms.
- Constraints from ancestral function shape the possibilities and limitations of social cognition (i.e., not arbitrary).

# Interpretation & Significance
The repurposing framework reframes "social brain" claims: rather than a wholly specialized social module, social cognition emerges from flexible re-use of domain-general circuits. This has consequences for computational modeling: models should leverage representational primitives (space, time, spectral structure) that the brain already computes.

# Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- **Lewin:** The emphasis on constraints resonates with *B = f(P,E,R)* — representations inherited from phylogeny shape behavior across environments.
- **Marr:** Encourages mid-level algorithmic models showing how spatial/temporal maps are reinterpreted to compute social variables.
- **Brunswik:** Would highlight the role of environmental and cultural scaffolds in shaping which repurposings are feasible.

# Teaching Hooks
- Use examples: how "social distance" maps onto spatial metaphors and neural metrics; show experiments where social and physical distances engage overlapping cortex.
- Analogy: brain as a toolbox where old tools get re-labeled and reused for new social tasks.

# Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 3/5
- Pre-requisites: basic evolutionary reasoning, cortical topography.
- Common misconceptions: "Repurposing = no specialization" — instead, specialization is constrained but flexible.

# Concept Graph
- Perceptual/spatial representations → repurposed → encode social variables (because cortical maps are flexible).
- Cultural practices → drive plastic changes → enable novel social functions (because repeated use biases circuit tuning).
- Constraints from ancestral function → limit possible social computations (because inherited circuitry carries legacy structure).

# Relevant Terms

**New Terms to Add:**
- *instrumental repurposing* — (if not already in glossary) explicit definition distinguishing short‑timescale, learning-driven reuse of circuits during an individual's lifetime.
