# Core Question / Problem
How are social knowledge and categories represented (schemas, prototypes, exemplars), and how do these representations shape perception, memory, and behavior?

# Conceptual or Computational Framework
The chapter presents a representational‑processing framework: representations (schemas, exemplars, prototypes, frames, scripts) mediate perception and action. It highlights interactions between bottom‑up associative learning and top‑down schema effects (priors), consistent with predictive processing accounts.

# Methods Overview
Survey of classic experiments (e.g., Bartlett, Markus self‑schema studies, Cohen role schema work) and more modern experimental paradigms (priming, subliminal triggers, IF→THEN relational elicitation).

# Key Findings
- Representations are fuzzy, probabilistic, and can be organized as prototypes or exemplars; which representation is used depends on familiarity and context.
- Self‑schemas facilitate encoding and retrieval for self‑relevant traits (faster RTs, richer recall).
- Embodied cognition: bodily states (temperature, posture, facial muscles) can implicitly influence social judgments (warmth, affect), often outside awareness.
- Ideomotor/priming effects demonstrate that activated representations can trigger matching behaviors (e.g., elderly stereotype priming slows walking); but replication crises temper some strong claims.

# Interpretation & Significance
The chapter stitches together classical schema theory with emerging embodied and automaticity findings. Pedagogically it gives students an operational toolkit to think about how knowledge structures influence perception and action, and how mindsets and construal level moderate processing.

# Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- Lewin: schemas are part of R in B = f(P,E,R) and shape goal‑directed action.
- Marr: computational goal = compress and infer category membership; algorithmic = exemplar matching vs prototype probability estimation.
- Brunswik: highlights cue validity and IF→THEN relations for relational theories.

# Teaching Hooks
- Demonstration: cold vs hot cup (embodied warmth) and subsequent social judgments (replicable conceptual discussion).
- Quick in‑class priming: show how schemas bias memory of a short vignette.

# Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 3/5
- Pre‑requisites: basic memory and category theory, priming concepts
- Common misconceptions: overinterpreting priming/embodiment as always large; discuss replication and boundary conditions.
- Discussion prompt: When will exemplar vs prototype representations dominate?

# Connections
- Links to Heider’s animacy (schemas for agents), Mitchell’s Marr framing (representations as algorithmic objects), and later lectures on predictive models.

# Key Quotes or Phrases
- “Schemas serve as filters that make stimuli knowable and actionable.”  
- “Embodied states often trigger metaphorically linked social inferences outside awareness.”
