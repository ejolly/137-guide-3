# Core Question / Problem
When and why do people perceive minds in others (including non-human entities), and what are the psychological and social consequences of that perception?

# Conceptual or Computational Framework
Waytz et al. synthesize behavioral, developmental, and neuroscientific evidence under a dual-dimension model of mind perception: **Agency** (capacity to plan/act) and **Experience** (capacity to feel). At Marr’s levels: computationally the goal is to infer hidden mental states to predict and connect; algorithmically people use coarse perceptual Turing tests followed by higher-order inference (heuristics like similarity, unpredictability, and effectance); implementationally, neural markers (e.g., mPFC engagement) index mind-attribution.

# Methods Overview
This is a theory-driven review integrating experiments across paradigms: morphing faces (animacy tipping points), EEG/fMRI studies of face and social perception, behavioral priming (belief in gods, surveillance cues), and social-psychological manipulations (loneliness, control threats) that alter anthropomorphism.

# Key Findings
- Mind perception operates on two separable axes: **Experience** and **Agency**, which can be dissociated in judgments. (See Gray et al., 2007.)
- Perceiver motives shape mind attribution: lack of causal control or high causal uncertainty increases ascriptions of agency (people explain unpredictability with minds). Loneliness and need for social connection increase attributions of mental states to non-humans.
- Target properties matter: humanlike appearance, humanlike motion, and perceived similarity increase mind attribution; out-group members, objects, or dehumanized targets receive lower mind ratings.
- Consequences: attributing mind confers moral status (moral patient = experience) and moral responsibility (agentic capacity). Conversely, denying mind enables dehumanization and moral exclusion.

# Interpretation & Significance
This paper reframes **mentalizing** not only as state inference (ToM) but as a graded perception system with clear antecedents and moral consequences. It connects basic perceptual triggers to higher-order social outcomes (e.g., punishment, empathy, moral typecasting). For the course’s computational lens, mind perception is an adaptive inference system that trades off accuracy and efficiency: fast detectors flag candidate minds, but higher-level reasoning (and social motives) determine commitment.

# Computational-Social-Cognitive-Scientist Hat
**What would Kurt Lewin think?** Lewin’s *B = f(P,E)* maps nicely: perceiver motives (P) and target features (E) jointly determine mind-attribution (B). He’d appreciate the field-theoretic, interactionist framing.

**What would David Marr think?** Marr would ask for explicit algorithms and representations: what are the decision rules for moving from low-level face/ motion signals to high-level mind-ascription? The two-stage detector+filter is a good start at Marr’s algorithmic level.

**What would Egon Brunswik think?** Brunswik would emphasize ecological validity: which environmental cues are reliable indicators of mind and how do perceivers weight noisy cues (lens model)? The paper’s cue-competition results fit a Brunswikian perspective.

# Teaching Hooks
- Show Heider & Simmel animation and ask students to list verbs/mental states; contrast with an animation of random motion.
- Demonstration: show morphed faces continuum and have students mark the animacy tipping point.
- Classroom poll: “Which entities deserve moral rights?” then discuss agency vs. experience.

# Pedagogical Lens
**Conceptual difficulty:** 3/5
**Pre-requisite ideas:** signal detection, basic ToM, stereotyping/dehumanization
**Common misconceptions:** mind-attribution is binary; perceiving mind equals moral approval
**Discussion question:** When is it adaptive to over-attribute minds? When is it adaptive to under-attribute them?

# Connections
Links to: animacy/biological motion research, dehumanization literature, implicit bias (mPFC differences), and predictive-processing views (the role of expectancy/prediction in tagging minds).

# Key Quotes or Phrases (for slides)
- "People think about other minds in terms of two distinct dimensions: experience and agency."
- "Attributing mind confers moral rights; denying mind licenses harm."

# Concept Graph
- Perceiver motives (loneliness, lack of control) → increase mind attribution because they satisfy needs for connection/effectance.
- Target cues (human likeness, unpredictability) → increase mind attribution because they signal agency/experience.
- Mind attribution → alters moral status (patient vs. agent) → changes helping/punishing behaviors.
