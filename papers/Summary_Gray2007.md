### Core Question / Problem
Do people represent minds in others along meaningful dimensions, and if so, what are those dimensions and their psychological consequences?

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
Gray et al. provide experimental evidence for a low-dimensional representation of minds (primarily Agency and Experience). At Marr’s levels: computational goal = compress a high-dimensional space of possible mental features into tractable dimensions for fast inference; algorithmic = two-dimensional mapping; implementational = patterns of attribution consistent across participants and correlations with moral judgments.

### Methods Overview
Multiple experiments: participants rated a variety of targets (humans, animals, gods, robots) on trait adjectives; principal components / factor analyses revealed two stable dimensions. Follow-up behavioral measures connect dimensions to moral judgments and perceived responsibility.

### Key Findings
- A two-factor structure (Experience, Agency) captures most variance in mind attributions.
- These dimensions predict distinct moral consequences: Experience predicts moral rights (do not harm), Agency predicts moral responsibility (blame, praise).

### Interpretation & Significance
A compact representational account explains diverse phenomena — anthropomorphism, dehumanization, moral judgments — by showing that a small set of latent dimensions governs social inference. This aligns with computational cognitive science’s emphasis on compressed representations for efficient prediction.

### Teaching Hooks
- Quick rating exercise: give students target list (baby, dog, robot, corpse) and ask them to place each on two axes.
- Explain PCA as a method for discovering dimensions.

### Pedagogical Lens
- Difficulty: 2/5
- Pre-reqs: basic stats (factor/PCA), ToM
- Misconception: dimensions are mutually exclusive; many targets score on both.

### Connections
- Strongly connected to Epley & Waytz, Waytz et al., and course glossary terms like agency/experience and moral typecasting.

### Key Quotes or Phrases
- "Mind perception is organized along dimensions of experience and agency."

### Concept Graph
- Target features → (map to) Agency/Experience → (drive) moral judgments.

### Relevant Terms
**Existing Terms Used:** agency; experience; mentalizing; moral typecasting.
