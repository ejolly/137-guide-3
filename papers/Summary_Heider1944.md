# Core Question / Problem
How do simple motion cues (shapes moving on a screen) provoke attributions of intentional action, social motives, and personality — i.e., when do observers treat abstract motion as “agents”?

# Conceptual or Computational Framework
Heider & Simmel operationalize the perceiver as a naïve scientist who infers internal states (beliefs, desires, intentions) from minimal perceptual input. At Marr’s levels: computationally, the problem is “infer causes (agents, goals) from motion”; algorithmically, it is mapping kinematic patterns to intentional explanations; implementational details are left unspecified.

# Methods Overview
Participants watched a short silent film showing geometric shapes (triangles, circle, rectangle) moving in a simple 2-D arena. They were asked to describe what they saw in their own words. The key manipulation is purely perceptual: only motion and spatial relations vary.

# Key Findings
- Nearly all observers provided narrativized, agentic descriptions (e.g., “the big triangle chased the little one to punish it”), attributing goals, beliefs, and social roles to geometric shapes.
- Motion patterns (self-propulsion, contingent interaction, approach/avoidance, goal-directed trajectories) reliably trigger attributions of animacy and intentionality.
- Observers spontaneously create causal and moral narratives from minimal cues.

# Interpretation & Significance
Heider & Simmel provide a clear demonstration that perception alone can trigger high-level social inferences. The study shows that agency detection and mentalizing are fast, automatic, and driven by diagnostic motion signatures — a foundational result for research on animacy perception, mentalizing, and the intentional stance.

# Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- Lewin: B = f(P, E, R) — This shows how perceptual input P (motion) combined with prior Representations (R: schemas about agents) shapes behavior (attribution).
- Marr: Computational goal = infer hidden agents/goals; algorithmic = mapping motion features → intentional explanation; implementational = unspecified.
- Brunswik: Emphasizes ecological validity — motion cues are probabilistic signals of agency and the perceiver uses ecological sampling (available cues) to infer hidden causes.

# Teaching Hooks
- Show short clips from the original animation and ask students to write 2‑sentence narratives; compare across students.
- Live demo: Two dots move contingently vs. randomly; ask students “Which is alive?” and discuss why.

# Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 2/5
- Pre‑requisites: basic idea of attribution and agency
- Common misconceptions: “Attribution requires rich cues” — Heider & Simmel show minimal cues suffice.
- Discussion prompt: What motion features would an algorithm use to decide “agent” vs “object”?

# Connections
- Links to animacy literature, biological motion (Johansson), and predictive‑processing accounts where small prediction errors about self‑propelled motion trigger agent hypotheses.

# Key Quotes or Phrases
- “Observers impose intentions and social roles on moving shapes.”  
- “Motion alone is sufficient to elicit richly structured social narratives.”

# Concept Graph
- Motion cues (self‑propulsion, contingency) → Animacy detection → Intentional stance → Mentalizing (goal/trait attributions)
