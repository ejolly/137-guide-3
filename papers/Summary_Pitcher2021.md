### Core Question / Problem
Does primate visual cortex contain more than the canonical dorsal and ventral pathways? Pitcher & Ungerleider synthesize anatomy, neurophysiology, fMRI and lesion evidence to propose a lateral/STS‑centered “third pathway” specialized for dynamic social perception (faces, bodies, gaze, expression, audiovisual speech).

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
The third pathway is an implementational/algorithmic claim: that early motion‑sensitive inputs (via MT/V5) feed a set of STS regions whose computations extract dynamic social cues and map them to higher‑level social interpretations (intent, expression, gaze).

### Methods Overview
This is an integrative review drawing on tracer anatomy in macaques, human fMRI (motion vs static faces), TMS/fMRI dissociations, and white‑matter tractography. Figures illustrate cortical connectivity and functional specialization of pSTS/aSTS.

### Key Findings
- Convergent evidence for a cortical stream projecting from early visual cortex (via MT) to STS that is anatomically and functionally distinct from ventral and dorsal streams.
- The STS responds selectively to biological motion, moving faces/bodies, eye‑gaze dynamics, and multisensory speech—functions critical to social perception.
- Disruption of STS regions selectively impairs dynamic face perception while sparing static identity processing (ventral stream).

### Interpretation & Significance
Introducing a third visual pathway reframes social perception as grounded in specific perceptual circuitry optimized for dynamic cues. This has implications for developmental disorders (autism) and for computational models: social inference requires fast extraction of temporal features (motion trajectories, gaze shifts) before higher‑level mentalizing.

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- Computational goal: extract agentive, intention‑relevant features from dynamic visual input.
- Algorithmic components: motion‑based segmentation, temporal pattern extraction, cross‑modal integration (audio+vision).
- Implementation: MT → pSTS/aSTS network (third pathway), projecting to nodes of social cognition (RTPJ, MPFC).

### Teaching Hooks
- Demonstrate with point‑light displays (biological motion) and static face images to show perceptual dissociations.
- Simple TMS thought experiment: predict which task (expression vs identity) would be impaired by targeted disruption.

### Pedagogical Lens
Use the third pathway to show how sensory preprocessing shapes higher social inference: representation of dynamic cues constrains what the mind can infer downstream.

### Connections
Connects to biological motion, animacy, and subsequent mentalizing computations in RTPJ/MPFC. Relevant to work on predictive coding of dynamic agents.

### Concept Graph
- Early visual cortex (V1) → MT/V5 (motion) → pSTS/aSTS (third pathway) → RTPJ/MPFC (mentalizing).
