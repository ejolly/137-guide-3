### Core Question / Problem
How should computational cognitive science evolve to explain real‑world behavior rather than constrained laboratory tasks? The authors argue for methods and models that embrace naturalistic data and testing regimes.

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
A synthesis arguing for the combination of (i) generative models that capture causal, compositional structure, (ii) scalable learning algorithms (amortized inference, meta‑learning), and (iii) experimental designs that collect continuous, multimodal behavior in rich environments. Marr’s levels motivate aligning computational goals with implementational constraints to maintain plausibility.

### Methods Overview
Recommendations include deploying virtual reality and continuous recording (video, motion, physiology), leveraging large‑scale annotated datasets, using hierarchical Bayesian and neural‑hybrid models, and developing benchmark tasks/test suites shared across labs.

### Key Findings / Proposals
- Naturalistic data expose representational demands (temporal structure, multi‑agent dynamics) that small lab tasks cannot.
- Hybrid models (neural networks with structured generative cores) are promising: they combine representational flexibility with inductive structure for sample‑efficient learning.
- Methodologically, the field needs open benchmarks, standardized tasks, and adversarial cooperation across labs (sharing tasks/data/models/tests).

### Interpretation & Significance
This paper operationalizes the “big data + big models” vision for cognitive science, emphasizing reproducibility and ecological validity. For social cognition, its approach directly supports studying dynamic mentalizing, multi‑agent interaction, and cultural/contextual effects.

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- Lewin: supportive of studying behavior as a function of life‑space dynamics in natural environments.
- Marr: would insist on precise computational goals and testable predictions despite ecological complexity.
- Brunswik: would welcome the multimodal, probabilistic sampling approach to environmental cues.

### Teaching Hooks
- Assign students to annotate a short social video for goal transitions and test which model (simple RL vs hierarchical generative) predicts human annotations.

### Pedagogical Lens
- Difficulty: 4/5
- Prereqs: Bayesian models, basic deep learning, experimental design for naturalistic data.
- Misconception: Naturalistic = messy/unusable. Counter by showing how structure can be extracted and constrained by models.

### Connections
- Bridges Predictive Mind, Flatland Fallacy critique, and Kriegeskorte et al.’s call for task‑performing models.

### Key Quotes or Phrases
- “To explain natural behavior we must meet naturalistic data on its own terms: temporally rich, multimodal, and socially structured.”  

### Relevant Terms
- **Existing Terms Used:** generative model, predictive mind, transition structure, naturalistic tasks.
