### Core Question / Problem
How do motivational forces — particularly needs to maintain self‑esteem and a sense of control — shape basic social cognition (impression formation, attribution, memory)?

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
Moskowitz frames social cognition as a goal‑directed process where epistemic and self‑protective motives bias information encoding and causal attribution. At Marr’s levels: computational = preserve self‑concept while making valid social predictions; algorithmic = biased sampling, defensive attribution, selective discounting of disconfirming evidence; implementational = cognitive strategies like selective attention and memory reconsolidation. fileciteturn1file12

### Methods Overview
Chapter summarizes classic experiments (e.g., Miller 1976 feedback paradigm; Sicoli & Ross 1977 manipulated success/failure feedback) and contemporary work showing how observers discount threatening information and question source reliability when feedback is negative.

### Key Findings
- People protect self‑esteem by reinterpreting negative feedback as situational (external attribution) and positive feedback as internal (ability). fileciteturn1file12  
- When observers give threatening feedback, perceivers often attack the observer’s credibility rather than update their self‑view — a motivated reasoning strategy. fileciteturn1file12  
- Epistemic needs shape impressions even from sparse or ambiguous input (creating meaning where objective evidence is thin).

### Interpretation & Significance
The chapter foregrounds motivation as central to social inference: cognitive mechanisms (attention, memory, attribution) are not neutral processors but are tuned by goals. This reframes “errors” in social judgment as adaptive responses to protect identity and manage uncertainty — linking to course themes of Representations and Predictive Mind (priors shaped by motivation). fileciteturn1file12

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
- Lewin: Motives are part of the life‑space that shape behavior (B = f(P,E,R)). fileciteturn2file15  
- Marr: Computational goal includes self‑preservation; algorithmic implementations are biased sampling and selective memory.

### Teaching Hooks
- Recreate Miller’s feedback manipulation as a classroom poll; compare reactions to positive vs negative feedback.  
- Discuss modern echo‑chamber phenomena (social media) as institutionalized motivated reasoning (Moskowitz cites contemporary social media work). fileciteturn1file12

### Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 2–3/5  
- Prereqs: Attribution theory, memory basics.  
- Misconception: People are primarily rational when judging self — corrected by motivated‑reasoning literature.

### Connections
- Links to Attribution Theory, Mentalizing, and Predictive Mind (priors shaped by motivation). fileciteturn2file15

### Key Quotes or Phrases
- "When the observer states the participant is responsible for a success, the participant judges the observer accurate; for failures, the observer is judged biased." fileciteturn1file12

### Concept Graph
- Threatening feedback → motivated discounting → preserves self‑esteem → alters social judgment.
