### Core Question / Problem
What mechanisms underlie the kiki‑bouba effect (angular vs. round shapes mapped to certain sounds)? Specifically, are emotion/arousal associations a mediating factor, and do explicit and implicit association tests reveal the same mapping patterns?

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
The authors propose an emotional‑mediation account: shapes and pseudowords share higher‑order emotional properties (e.g., high arousal ↔ kiki, anger ↔ angular). They test whether explicit and implicit measures tap the same or different processes—suggesting multiple routes to cross‑modal correspondence (articulatory vs. acoustic vs. emotional mediation).

### Methods Overview
Three experiments combining explicit association tasks and implicit measures (IAT), reaction‑time analyses, and manipulation of congruency across emotion/shape/sound pairings. Stimuli included angular vs. rounded shapes, kiki‑like vs. bouba‑like pseudowords (auditory), and facial expressions (angry, happy, calm).

### Key Findings
- Explicit association tasks reliably link kiki‑like words and angular shapes to high‑arousal/angry expressions and bouba‑like words and rounded shapes to low‑arousal/happy/calm expressions.  
- Implicit Association Test (IAT) responses showed a robust link between shapes and emotions, but the implicit link between aurally presented pseudowords and emotions was weaker or absent.  
- Conclusion: emotional mediation plausibly contributes to the kiki‑bouba effect for visual shapes, but phonetic/articulatory routes also play a role; explicit and implicit tasks tap partially distinct processes.

### Interpretation & Significance
The study argues for a multi‑route account: shape–emotion associations are processed implicitly (perhaps perceptual arousal mapping), while sound–emotion links may require explicit attention or be mediated by articulatory/learning processes. This refines accounts of sound symbolism by showing domain‑specific differences in implicit processing.

### Computational‑Social‑Cognitive‑Scientist Hat
Modeling implication: multiple feature spaces (visual curvature, acoustic spectral centroid, arousal axis) map onto emotion space; explicit tasks access higher‑level mappings that may integrate articulatory knowledge, while implicit tasks reflect low‑level perceptual–affective coupling. A latent variable model with cross‑modal loadings could capture these effects.

### Teaching Hooks
- Classroom demo: quick kiki‑bouba matching (visual and auditory) and compare explicit choices vs. a timed implicit measure (reaction times).  
- Discuss cross‑modal correspondences as a bridge between perception, language, and emotion.

### Pedagogical Lens
Use to illustrate how implicit and explicit measures dissociate cognitive processes. Connect to cross‑modal perception, predictive coding (expectations across modalities), and embodied accounts (articulatory correlates to meanings).

### Connections
Ties to Sievers et al. (2013, 2019) on cross‑modal emotion codes, articulatory theories (Ramachandran & Hubbard), and literature on sound symbolism and language evolution.
