### Core Question / Problem
When and why do people attribute minds to others (including non-human agents), and what are the psychological consequences of those attributions?

### Conceptual or Computational Framework
This chapter frames mind perception as a two-dimensional representational space — **Experience** (capacity to feel) and **Agency** (capacity to act/plan) — that underlies anthropomorphism and mentalizing. At the computational level, the problem is: given observable behavior, how should a perceiver infer hidden mental-state variables (feelings, intentions) for prediction and social coordination? Algorithmically, people use quick heuristics (similarity, causal uncertainty, need for social connection) and stance-taking (intentional/design/physical) to map observable cues to latent mental attributes. Implementationally, the chapter points to neural correlates (e.g., mPFC) for social inference.

### Methods Overview
This is a theory-and-review chapter synthesizing developmental studies (infancy sensitivity to goal-directed motion), experimental manipulations that trigger anthropomorphism (loneliness, lack of control), neuroimaging contrasts showing differential MPFC activation, and cross-species comparisons. The chapter emphasizes converging behavioral and correlational evidence rather than a single new experiment.

### Key Findings
- People represent minds along two stable dimensions: **Agency** and **Experience**. 
- Perceiver motives (need for understanding, control, or social connection) and perceived target features (human-likeness, unpredictability, similarity) jointly determine mind attributions.
- Attributing mind changes moral treatment: agents are more blameworthy; patients more deserving of moral rights.
- Anthropomorphism can be adaptive (satisfying effectance or social needs) and maladaptive (objectification or moral neglect).

### Interpretation & Significance
Epley & Waytz synthesize scattered literatures into a compact representational model that explains when people ascribe minds and why it matters for moral judgment and social behavior. For the course’s computational lens, their synthesis shows how representational constraints (agency vs experience) guide fast inference strategies that act like approximate generative models for social prediction.

### Computational-Social-Cognitive-Scientist Hat
- Kurt Lewin: This account operationalizes *B = f(P, E)* by showing how perceiver state (P) and environment/target (E) map to representations (R) of mind.
- David Marr: Marr’s computational level = “explain/predict others’ behavior”; algorithmic = the two-dimension heuristic + stance-taking; implementational = social brain circuits (mPFC, TPJ).
- Egon Brunswik: Ecological validity arises from the reliability of cues (human-like motion, contingency).

### Teaching Hooks
- Play a short Heider & Simmel clip (triangles) and ask students to annotate perceived feelings/intentions.
- Analogy: mind perception as a 2‑axis map (agency x experience) — place pets, infants, robots, corporations on the map.

### Pedagogical Lens
- Conceptual difficulty: 2/5
- Pre-requisite ideas: Attributions, basic experimental logic, representational models
- Common misconceptions: Anthropomorphism = irrational; in fact it is often goal-directed inference.
- Prompt: "Design a 5-minute experiment that tests whether loneliness increases agency or experience attributions to a household object."

### Connections
- Marr’s levels, intentional stance (Dennett), predictive mind, moral typecasting.

### Key Quotes or Phrases
- "Mind perception organizes in terms of capacity to feel and capacity to plan." 
- "Ascribing a mind confers moral standing and responsibility."

### Concept Graph
- Perceiver motives → (increase) Anthopomorphism because they raise need for effectance.
- Humanlike cues → (increase) Agency/Experience because of cue reliability.
- Mind attribution → (causes) Moral status shifts (rights or blame).
