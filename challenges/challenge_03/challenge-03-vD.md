### 3.
The lectures also emphasized a distinct view of AI models suggesting they're good capturing **subjective** human judgments, not objective truth. What were the key implications of this idea?

**(B)** People are only capable of accurately recognizing emotional expressions from members of their own culture.  
**(C)** Emotional expressions are entirely universal, with specific facial configurations meaning the same thing in every culture without exception.

**(D)** People only changed their views on peripheral, unimportant traits.  

### 13.
A key insight from the third part of the course on 'Social Signals' is that our perception of others is heavily influenced by a process of overgeneralization within the first 200ms. Which example best illustrates this?

**(B)** Deducing a person's intentions by carefully observing their behavior over a long period.  
**(C)** Assuming a person is trustworthy because their neutral facial structure resembles a smile.  
**(D)** Feeling more connected to someone because your physiological states synchronized during a shared experience.  

### 14.
Research on visceral states like hunger shows they can lead to influence judgements and decision-making'. What is an example of this?

**(B)** Accurately planning your grocery shopping for the week regardless of your current hunger level.  
**(C)** Choosing healthier food options when you are hungry.

### 16.
According the lectures, which of the following is a central aspect of perception?

**(B)** It is a passive process of receiving sensory information from the environment.  
**(C)** It is entirely separate from higher-level cognitive functions like memory and expectation.  
**(D)** It primarily involves complex cognitive calculations, similar to solving a prime number division problem.

**(A)** In-group bias only forms when groups have a long history of shared experiences and values.  
**(B)** Arbitrary and meaningless group assignments are sufficient to create in-group favoritism.

**(B)** Friends were unable to accurately predict the target person's personality traits.  
**(C)** Each person's brain activity for 'self' was entirely unique and unlike anyone else's.  
**(D)** Thinking about the self activated the same brain region responsible for visual perception.  

### 20.
From a bounded rationality perspective, why does the human mind rely on categorization and stereotyping?

**(A)** Because it is a slow, deliberate process that engages our full cognitive capacity.  
**(B)** To promote social harmony by highlighting similarities between all groups.  
**(C)** To simplify the complex social world and conserve cognitive resources.  
**(D)** To ensure the most accurate and nuanced understanding of every individual.  

### 21.
When interpreting emotions, research shows that context (like body language or the surrounding scene) plays a significant role. How does this challenge a simple 'basic emotion' view?

**(A)** It confirms that certain facial muscle configurations have fixed, universal meanings regardless of the situation.  
**(B)** It suggests that the meaning of a facial expression is not inherent to the face alone but is constructed through integration with other available cues.

**(A)** The doctor's belief had no significant effect; patients' pain ratings were the same regardless of the doctor's belief.  
**(B)** The doctor's belief was transmitted non-verbally through subtle facial expressions, which altered the patient's subjective experience of pain.  
**(C)** The doctor explicitly told the patient which treatment they believed was better, influencing the patient's expectation.
