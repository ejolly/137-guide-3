## Version A

### 1.
According the lectures, which of the following is a central aspect of perception?

**(A)** It primarily involves complex cognitive calculations, similar to solving a prime number division problem.  
**(B)** It is entirely separate from higher-level cognitive functions like memory and expectation.  
**(C)** It is fundamentally an act of categorization, where we assign perceived objects to groups and memberships.  
**(D)** It is a passive process of receiving sensory information from the environment.  

### 2.

**(C)** Having the group leaders negotiate a peace treaty.  
**(D)** Educating the boys about the negative effects of prejudice.  

### 3.
Henri Tajfel's Minimal Group Paradigm experiments revealed a fundamental aspect of social identity. What was the key finding?

**(A)** In-group bias only forms when groups have a long history of shared experiences and values.  
**(B)** Competition over resources is a necessary condition for people to favor their own group.  
**(C)** Arbitrary and meaningless group assignments are sufficient to create in-group favoritism.  
**(D)** People will only favor their in-group if they stand to gain personal rewards from it.

**(B)** Warmth and Competence  
**(C)** Introversion and Extroversion  
**(D)** Attractiveness and Intelligence  

### 5.
From a bounded rationality perspective, why does the human mind rely on categorization and stereotyping?

**(A)** To ensure the most accurate and nuanced understanding of every individual.  
**(B)** Because it is a slow, deliberate process that engages our full cognitive capacity.  
**(C)** To promote social harmony by highlighting similarities between all groups.

**(A)** Physiognomy  
**(B)** Eugenics  
**(C)** Phrenology  
**(D)** Behaviorism  

### 7.

### 8.
In the study on socially transmitted placebo effects (Chen et al., 2019), how did the doctor's belief about a treatment affect the patient, even when the physical stimulation was identical for both treatments?

**(C)** The doctor subtly altered the temperature of the pain stimulation based on their belief without realizing it.

What is the most accurate summary of the research on the universality of facial expressions, as presented in the lectures?

**(A)** People are only capable of accurately recognizing emotional expressions from members of their own culture.  
**(B)** There is evidence for cross-cultural consistency in recognizing expressions, but interpretation is heavily shaped by context, culture, and in-group experience.  
**(C)** There is no universality; the interpretation of facial expressions is completely random and specific to each individual.  
**(D)** Emotional expressions are entirely universal, with specific facial configurations meaning the same thing in every culture without exception.

**(B)** A complex emotional state that requires deep introspection to understand.  
**(C)** A cognitive heuristic or shortcut that influences our judgments and evaluations.

**(B)** Our perception of how other people see and judge us.  
**(C)** The biological and genetic traits we inherit from our parents.  
**(D)** A process of compressing our past experiences into a stable set of facts.  

### 12.
The fMRI study by Chavez and Wagner (2020) provided neural evidence for the 'socially constructed self' by showing that:

**(A)** Each person's brain activity for 'self' was entirely unique and unlike anyone else's.  
**(B)** The pattern of brain activity when a person thought about themselves was recapitulated in their friends' brains when thinking about that person.  
**(C)** Friends were unable to accurately predict the target person's personality traits.  
**(D)** Thinking about the self activated the same brain region responsible for visual perception.  

### 13.
What distinguishes the 'self as a causal narrative' view from the 'self as an internal schema' view?

**(A)** The causal narrative view denies that the self is based on memory.  
**(B)** The causal narrative view emphasizes the sequence and perceived causal connections between traits and memories over time.  
**(C)** The internal schema view is the only one that incorporates feedback from other people.  
**(D)** The causal narrative view suggests the self is entirely fixed and unchanging, like a written book.  

### 14.
Research on visceral states like hunger shows they can lead to influence judgements and decision-making'. What is an example of this?

**(B)** Experiencing a vivid, first-person memory of a past event.  
**(C)** Learning a new physical skill through repetition, like riding a bike.

**(C)** Believing that the members of your own book club have diverse tastes in literature.  
**(D)** Thinking that a person from another country is very different from you.  

### 17.
The lectures also emphasized a distinct view of AI models suggesting they're good capturing **subjective** human judgments, not objective truth. What were the key implications of this idea?

**(A)** An AI's judgment that a face looks 'untrustworthy' is an objective fact about that person's character.  
**(B)** The technology is not yet advanced enough, but will soon be able to objectively measure personality from a photo.  
**(C)** These models can be used as tools to reverse-engineer and understand the subjective cues people use to form impressions.  
**(D)** AI models have successfully eliminated all human biases from their predictions.  

### 18.
When interpreting emotions, research shows that context (like body language or the surrounding scene) plays a significant role. How does this challenge a simple 'basic emotion' view?

**(A)** It suggests that the meaning of a facial expression is not inherent to the face alone but is constructed through integration with other available cues.  
**(B)** It proves that emotion perception is a purely cultural phenomenon with no biological basis.  
**(C)** It shows that people primarily rely on faces and tend to ignore contextual information when making emotion judgments.  
**(D)** It confirms that certain facial muscle configurations have fixed, universal meanings regardless of the situation.  

### 19.
A key trade-off of using heuristics like stereotyping is that they are particularly inaccurate and unhelpful in which type of environment?

**(A)** The centrality of a trait had no effect on how people updated their beliefs.  
**(B)** People only changed their views on peripheral, unimportant traits.  
**(C)** People were more likely to change their self-perception of a trait the more central (influential) a trait was  
**(D)** People ignored all feedback about their most central traits to protect their core identity.

**(B)** Episodic memory relates to future plans, while semantic memory relates to past events.  
**(C)** Episodic memory is for facts and knowledge, while semantic memory is for personal experiences.  
**(D)** Episodic memory is part of our implicit, non-declarative system, while semantic memory is explicit.  

### 23.
A key insight from the third part of the course on 'Social Signals' is that our perception of others is heavily influenced by a process of overgeneralization within the first 200ms. Which example best illustrates this?

**(A)** Assuming a person is trustworthy because their neutral facial structure resembles a smile.  
**(B)** Deducing a person's intentions by carefully observing their behavior over a long period.
