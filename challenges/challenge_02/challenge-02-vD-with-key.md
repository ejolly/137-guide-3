### 12.
During lecture & on Canvas, you saw the sigmoid (S-shaped) utility function from Prospect theory with loss <-> gain on the X-axis and pleasure (positive) <-> pain (negative) utility on the Y-axis.

### 13.
You're trying to decide which of two fellowships to apply for and you turn to your Herb Nash for advice who says:  
*"It sounds like there's a 10% chance you're going to get the Fellowship A ($200k). But if you finish your thesis, get all your reference letters, and maintain a 3.7 GPA by the end of the quarter you could probably raise your chances it to 50%. Fellowship B only requires a 3 page essay, but it's a 50% chance for less money ($120k). If I were you I would apply to Fellowship B."*
