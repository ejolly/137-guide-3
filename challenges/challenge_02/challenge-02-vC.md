# Challenge 02 - Mon Nov-10-25

**Instructions:**

You will have the full lecture time to answer all 22 multiple choice questions. Each question is worth 2 points. Think carefully about what each question asks and what each answer claims - we're not trying to trick you! Good luck!

---


### 1.
How does the 'framing effect' introduced by Prospect Theory demonstrate the subjectivity of value?

**(A)** The same monetary outcome is evaluated differently depending on whether it's presented as a loss or gain  
**(B)** People are biased because they make the wrong choice  
**(C)** Choices vary across people, but each person always makes consistent choices  
**(D)** People are consistently risk-seeking based on their subject preferences  

### 2.
You're trying to decide which of two fellowships to apply for and you turn to your Herb Nash for advice who says:  
*"It sounds like there's a 10% chance you're going to get the Fellowship A ($200k). But if you finish your thesis, get all your reference letters, and maintain a 3.7 GPA by the end of the quarter you could probably raise your chances it to 50%. Fellowship B only requires a 3 page essay, but it's a 50% chance for less money ($120k). If I were you I would apply to Fellowship B."*
Is their advice more consistent with Homo-Economicus or Homo-Heuristicus?

**(A)** Economicus because the Probability of getting Fellowship B > A  
**(B)** Heuristicus because the Expected Value of Fellowship B = A for less effort  
**(C)** Heuristicus because the Probability of getting Fellowship B > A  
**(D)** Economicus because the Expected Value of Fellowship B > A  

### 3.
What is the point of a utility function?

**(C)** Incentivizing group level outcomes  
**(D)** A & B  

### 13.
According to the principles discovered in Axelrod's Tournament, which of the following best describes a 'nice' strategy?

**(D)** A person's happiness from an bonus depends on whether they were expecting one or not  

### 15.
From a resource rationality perspective, why might humans rely on a simple heuristic like Tit-for-Tat instead of calculating the mathematically optimal move in every social interaction?

**(A)** Tit-for-tat is the only strategy that guarantees a player will never lose a game  
**(B)** Humans are incapable of complex calculations and have to use simple rules  
**(C)** It's highly adaptive in environments where repeated interactions are likely*  
**(D)** The mathematically optimal strategy is too emotionally difficult for humans to execute  

### 16.

### 18.
In a one-shot (non-repeated) Prisoner's Dilemma, what is the "Nash Equilibrium" and why does it represent a dilemma?

**(A)** both player choose *defect*; it's a dilemma because the best individual choice produces the worst outcome for both players

**(C)** one player cooperates while the other defects; it's a dilemma because the cooperator receives the worst outcome for doing the right things  
**(D)** both player choose randomly to cooperate/defect; it's a dilemma because the outcome is unpredictable and depends on both players' choices  

### 19.

**(A)** Social networks quickly break down all defection, leading to widespread cooperation  
**(B)** Punishment spreads through networks, making everyone more cooperative  
**(C)** A single act of cooperation can indirectly influence others to cooperate more  
**(D)** Because an individual's choices are only affected by the people around them  

### 20.
During lecture & on Canvas, you saw the sigmoid (S-shaped) utility function from Prospect theory with loss <-> gain on the X-axis and pleasure (positive) <-> pain (negative) utility on the Y-axis.

**(A)** For every $1 increase in wealth, you experience < 1 unit increase in happiness when your starting wealth is high
**(B)** A & C
**(C)** For every $1 increase in wealth, you experience > 1 unit increase in happiness when your starting wealth is low

### 21.
