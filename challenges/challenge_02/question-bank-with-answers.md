### 21. 
During lecture & on Canvas, you saw the sigmoid (S-shaped) utility function from Prospect theory with loss <-> gain on the X-axis and pleasure (positive) <-> pain (negative) utility on the Y-axis. What does this function say about the relationship between *gaining* money and any *happiness* you might experience?

- **A.** For every $1 increase in wealth, you experience 1 unit decrease in happiness (utility)
- **B.** For every $1 increase in wealth, you experience > 1 unit increase in happiness when your starting wealth is low
- **C.** For every $1 increase in wealth, you experience < 1 unit increase in happiness when your starting wealth is high

### 22. 
You're trying to decide which of two fellowships to apply for and you turn to your Herb Nash for advice who says:  
*"It sounds like there's a 10% chance you're going to get the Fellowship A ($200k). But if you finish your thesis, get all your reference letters, and maintain a 3.7 GPA by the end of the quarter you could probably raise your chances it to 50%. Fellowship B only requires a 3 page essay, but it's a 50% chance for less money ($120k). If I were you I would apply to Fellowship B."*

Is their advice more consistent with Homo-Economicus or Homo-Heuristicus? 

- **C.** Economicus because the Probability of getting Fellowship B > A
- **B.** Heuristicus because the Probability of getting Fellowship B > A
- **A.** Economicus because the Expected Value of Fellowship B > A
- **D.** **Heuristicus because the Expected Value of Fellowship B = A for less effort**
