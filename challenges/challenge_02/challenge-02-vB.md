# Challenge 02 - Mon Nov-10-25

**Instructions:**

You will have the full lecture time to answer all 22 multiple choice questions. Each question is worth 2 points. Think carefully about what each question asks and what each answer claims - we're not trying to trick you! Good luck!

### 1.
Which of the following is an example of 'satisficing'?

**(A)** Going to the cafe with the easiest name to pronounce  
**(B)** Picking the first cafe you see that meets your basic criteria for food, price, and time  
**(C)** Always going to same cafe  
**(D)** Systematically researching every cafe on campus to create a spreadsheet with ratings, prices, and distance to choose the best place  

### 2.
In a one-shot (non-repeated) Prisoner's Dilemma, what is the "Nash Equilibrium" and why does it represent a dilemma?

**(A)** both player choose *defect*; it's a dilemma because the best individual choice produces the worst outcome for both players  
**(B)** both player choose randomly to cooperate/defect; it's a dilemma because the outcome is unpredictable and depends on both players' choices  
**(C)** one player cooperates while the other defects; it's a dilemma because the cooperator receives the worst outcome for doing the right things  
**(D)** both players choose cooperate; it's a dilemma because defecting would earn both players a higher reward  

### 3.
What is the point of a utility function?

**(A)** it describes how irrational a decider is  
**(B)** it ensures that decider's choices are rational  
**(C)** it maps objective outcomes to subjective value  
**(D)** to calculate the long-run average value of an outcome  

### 4.
Prospect Theory introduced the concept of a 'reference point'. What does this mean?

**(A)** It allowed for modeling of non-monetary outcomes like emotions  
**(B)** People's true preferences violate EUT axioms because of intransitivity   
**(C)** It demonstrated that people are always risk-averse regardless of the situation  
**(D)** It suggests that people evaluate gains & losses in a relative rather than absolute way  

### 5.
During lecture & on Canvas, you saw the sigmoid (S-shaped) utility function from Prospect theory with loss <-> gain on the X-axis and pleasure (positive) <-> pain (negative) utility on the Y-axis. What does this function say about the relationship between *gaining* money and any *happiness* you might experience?

**(A)** For every $1 increase in wealth, you experience 1 unit decrease in happiness (utility)
**(B)** For every $1 increase in wealth, you experience < 1 unit increase in happiness when your starting wealth is high
**(C)** B & D
**(D)** For every $1 increase in wealth, you experience > 1 unit increase in happiness when your starting wealth is low  

### 6.
You're trying to decide which of two fellowships to apply for and you turn to your Herb Nash for advice who says:  
*"It sounds like there's a 10% chance you're going to get the Fellowship A ($200k). But if you finish your thesis, get all your reference letters, and maintain a 3.7 GPA by the end of the quarter you could probably raise your chances it to 50%. Fellowship B only requires a 3 page essay, but it's a 50% chance for less money ($120k). If I were you I would apply to Fellowship B."*
Is their advice more consistent with Homo-Economicus or Homo-Heuristicus?

**(A)** Economicus because the Expected Value of Fellowship B > A  
**(B)** Economicus because the Probability of getting Fellowship B > A  
**(C)** Heuristicus because the Expected Value of Fellowship B = A for less effort  
**(D)** Heuristicus because the Probability of getting Fellowship B > A  

### 7.
The study by Fowler and Christakis (2010) re-analyzed data from a Public Goods Game and found that cooperative behavior could cascade through social networks. How?

**(A)** Social networks quickly break down all defection, leading to widespread cooperation  
**(B)** A single act of cooperation can indirectly influence others to cooperate more  
**(C)** Because an individual's choices are only affected by the people around them  
**(D)** Punishment spreads through networks, making everyone more cooperative  

### 8.
Which of the following is not one of the five *evolutionary dynamics* that influence cooperation discussed in lecture?

**(A)** kin selection  
**(B)** direct reciprocity  
**(C)** indirect reciprocity  
**(D)** conversation  

### 9.
In studies of the Public Goods game, _____ has been shown to increase average levels of cooperation over time.

**(A)** Punishing defectors
**(B)** A & D
**(C)** Incentivizing group level outcomes
**(D)** Having some resilient cooperators  

### 10.
From a resource rationality perspective, why might humans rely on a simple heuristic like Tit-for-Tat instead of calculating the mathematically optimal move in every social interaction?

**(A)** It's highly adaptive in environments where repeated interactions are likely*  
**(B)** Tit-for-tat is the only strategy that guarantees a player will never lose a game  
**(C)** The mathematically optimal strategy is too emotionally difficult for humans to execute  
**(D)** Humans are incapable of complex calculations and have to use simple rules  

### 11.
What do the two blades in Herbert Simon's "scissors" metaphor represent?

**(A)** the utility of subjective & objective value  
**(B)** the interaction between contextual demands of the environment & cognitive capabilities of an agent

### 12.
Which of the following scenarios best illustrates a 'zero-sum game'?

**(A)** Two companies investing in a new technology that could grow the entire market, allowing both to profit  
**(B)** A game of poker where the money one player wins is the exact amount the other players have lost  
**(C)** Drivers in traffic trying to merge, where smooth coordination can get everyone to their destination faster  
**(D)** A group of students working on a project, where everyone receives the same grade based on the final quality of the work  

### 13.

### 20.
